Could there be a compounding tragedy in dying despite choosing the path of security, the boring path, a life of quiet desperation. For some, adventure is thrust upon them and to die in these circumstances could be seen as heroic. Might suburban westerners feel a sense of jealousy if they meet the same fate as someone who has lived 100 of their lives by means of forced adventure? This is the height of first-world problems, when the great equaliser of death is treated unequally, but it might point us to a lack that needs to be addressed, a lack of struggle.</p>
