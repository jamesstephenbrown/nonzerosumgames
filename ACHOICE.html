So, in a world where they may be a higher purpose, not handed down to us by a god but emergent in the process of higher complexity replicators - it appears we have an existential choice, if indeed we have any power to "choose" at all. We can play our part in the emergent plan, and become a cell in a larger body that can achieve greater things than we could imagine and in so doing lose all autonomy, or we become the free-radical or the cancer in the system and maintain our autonomy at all costs. Neither option seems appealing. On the one hand by pursuing progress we could be, once again, stretching humanity's elasticated waistband and failing to enjoy what we could have, right now. On the other hand, in the same way a free-radical is a pest in a unified system, or a cancer cell is immortal but at the expense of the host, we might find ourselves, and even consciousness itself, being ultimately rejected by the process of emergence. This is the 3rd alignment problem; between conscious life and relentless emergence.<br></p>
