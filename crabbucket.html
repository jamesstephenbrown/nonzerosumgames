             According to some highly authoratitive anecdotal accounts, when a lone crab is placed in a bucket it will crawl out of its own accord <i><b>but</b></i> put a pile of crabs in a bucket and they will pull each other down in an attempt to escape, dooming them all. This is a classic illustration of a <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#NegativeSumGames"><b>negative</b>-sum game</a>, and these games, as the name implies, are <i>just the worst</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways of looking at this illustration<sub> • • •</sub>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Similar to <b>Tall Poppy Syndrome</b> whereby people are pulling others down to their level, purely out of spite or to make themselves feel better relative to others.</li>
                <li>A <a href="whoismoloch.html">Moloch</a>-y system whereby the narrow individual imperative to escape results in an incentive to use others to climb out, which results in no one escaping.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            A counterpoint to this illustration could be a situation where crabs (which are quite capable of holding on to each other) could form a ladder, and then a <i>sort of</i> rolling chain to enable the escape of everyone.
        </p>
        <p>

        <br>
        Sometimes we are told that acting in our own narrow self-interest is natural <i>or even <b>good</i></b>. Crabs in a bucket illustrates that in many situations narrow self-interest is counter-productive and that thinking about our own position relative to others can leave everyone worse off.

            <p>
                <h3>AN EXAMPLE FROM HISTORY</h3>
                <p>
                As a child I was horrified by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster" target="_blank">Hillsborough Disaster<sup>^</sup></a> where overcrowding at an FA Cup semi-final resulted in a massive human crush as panicked Liverpool supporters tried to escape. I remember my dad trying to explain to me how almost 100 people could be crushed and killed by accident <i>(the breakdown of systems and the ills of groupthink are subjects for another time)</i>.
                <br><br>
                Adding to the tragedy, over the succeeding years, the public saw another example of crabs in a bucket as authorities, media and management attempted to evade responsibility by each blaming the other <i>and the victims</i>.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>WHAT ABOUT YOU?</h3>
        <p>
        No doubt you've found yourself in situations where someone has pulled you down to get ahead? Perhaps you've fallen prey to <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#ZeroSumGames">zero-sum</a> thinking yourself, assuming it's you or them? Sometimes it might seem like we're all crabs in a bucket.
        <br><br>
        But how often does the opposite happen? Where humans support each other to achieve <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#PositiveSumGames">win-win</a> scenarios? How often do fellow employees turn up to work regularly, drivers <a href="nashequilibrium.html">stop at red lights</a>, customers provide free word-of-mouth advertising for businesses, not to mention all the support families provide for each another?
        <br><br>

        <br>
        While the concept of crabs in a bucket can help us to anticipate the negative outcomes of zero-sum thinking, it's important to remember - <b><i>we are not crabs!</i></b> Through recognising that others don't operate selfishly most of the time, we can exercise greater trust in one another and climb out of <i>them</i> buckets together.
