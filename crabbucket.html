        <p>
            Have you ever found yourself in a situation where someone has pulled you down to get ahead? Perhaps you've fallen prey to <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#ZeroSumGames">zero-sum</a> thinking yourself, assuming it's you or them? Welcome to... 
        </p>
<h3>THE CRAB BUCKET</h3>
        <p>
             According to some highly authoratitive anecdotal accounts, when a lone crab is placed in a bucket, it will crawl out of its own accord <em><strong>but</strong></em> put a pile of crabs in a bucket and they will pull each other down in an attempt to escape, dooming them all. This is a classic illustration of a <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#NegativeSumGames"><strong>negative</strong>-sum game</a>, and these games, as the name implies, are <em><strong>just the worst</strong></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways of looking at this illustration...
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome" target="_blank">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a> whereby people are pulling others down to their level, purely out of spite or to make themselves feel better relative to others.</li>
                <li>A <a href="whoismoloch.html">Molochian</a> system whereby the narrow individual imperative to escape, results in an incentive to use others to climb out, which results in no one escaping.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            A counterpoint to this illustration could be a situation where crabs (which are quite capable of holding on to each other) could form a ladder, and then a <em>sort of</em> rolling chain to enable the escape of everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="./Images/Content/CrabBucket.png" alt="Crabs making a chain pulling the other crabs out of the bucket"><br>
        <br>
        Sometimes we are told that acting in our own narrow self-interest is natural <em>or even <strong>good</em></strong>. Crabs in a bucket illustrates that in many situations narrow self-interest is counter-productive and that thinking about our own position <a href="absolutevsrelative.html">relative</a> to others can leave everyone worse off.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
                <a name="HillsboroughDisaster"></a>
                <h3>AN EXAMPLE FROM HISTORY</h3>

                <p>As a child I was horrified by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster" target="_blank">Hillsborough Disaster</a> where overcrowding at an FA Cup semi-final resulted in a massive human crush as panicked Liverpool supporters tried to escape. I remember my dad trying to explain to me how almost 100 people could be crushed and killed by accident.</p>
                Adding to the tragedy, over the succeeding years, the public saw another example of crabs in a bucket as authorities, media and management attempted to evade responsibility by each blaming the other <em>and the victims</em>.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Sometimes it can seem like we're all crabs in a bucket.</p>

        <p>But how often does the opposite happen? Where humans support each other to achieve <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#PositiveSumGames">win-win</a> scenarios? How often do fellow employees turn up to work regularly, drivers <a href="nashequilibrium.html">stop at red lights</a>, customers provide free word-of-mouth advertising for businesses, not to mention all the support families provide for each another?</p>

        <h3>SO...</h3>
        <p>While the concept of crabs in a bucket can help us to anticipate the negative outcomes of zero-sum thinking, it's important to rememberâ€”<strong><em>we are not crabs!</em></strong> Through recognising that others don't operate selfishly most of the time, we can exercise greater trust in one another and climb out of those buckets together.</p>
