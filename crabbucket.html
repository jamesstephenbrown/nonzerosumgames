        <h1>CRABS IN A BUCKET!</h1>
        <img src="./Images/Content/crab.png" alt="Cute crab">
        <p>
            This is a classic illustration of a <i><b>negative</b></i>-sum system whereby crabs pull each other down in an attempt to escape a bucket resulting in no crabs escaping<sub>•</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways of looking at this illustration<sub> • • •</sub>
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="lightColumn">
            <p>
            <ol>
            <li>
                Similar to <b>Tall Poppy Syndrome</b> whereby people are pulling others down to their level, purely out of spite or to make themselves feel better relative to others.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                A <a href="https://futureoflife.org/podcast/liv-boeree-on-moloch-beauty-filters-game-theory-institutions-and-ai/">Moloch</a>-y system whereby the narrow individual imperative to escape results in an incentive to use others to climb out, which results in no one escaping.
            </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            </div>
        </div>

            The counterpoint to this illustration is a situation where crabs (which are quite capable of holding on to each other) could form a ladder, and then a <i>sort of</i> rolling chain to enable the escape of everyone<sub>•</sub>

        Sometimes we are told that acting in our own narrow self-interest is natural <i>or even <b>good</i></b><sub>•</sub> Crabs in a bucket illustrates that in many situations narrow self-interest is counter-productive and that thinking about our own position relative to others can leave everyone worse off<sub>•</sub>

                <h3>AN EXAMPLE FROM HISTORY</h3>
                <p>
                As a child I was horrified by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster">Hillsborough Disaster</a> where overcrowding at an FA Cup semi-final resulted in a massive human crush as panicked Liverpool supporters tried to escape<sub>•</sub> I remember my dad trying to explain to me how almost 100 people could be crushed and killed by accident <i>(the breakdown of systems and the ills of groupthink are subjects for another time)</i><sub>•</sub>
                <br><br>
                Adding to the tragedy, over the succeeding years, the public saw another example of crabs in a bucket as authorities, media and management attempted to evade responsibility by each blaming the other <i>and the victims</i><sub>•</sub>
            </p>

        </div>
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT ABOUT YOU?</h3>
        <p>
        No doubt you've found yourself in situations where someone has pulled you down to get ahead? Perhaps you've fallen prey to zero-sum thinking yourself, assuming it's you or them? Sometimes it might seem like we're all crabs in a bucket<sub>•</sub>
        <br><br>
        But how often does the opposite happen? Where humans support each other to achieve win-win scenarios? How often do fellow employees turn up to work regularly, drivers stop at red lights, customers provide free word-of-mouth advertising for businesses, not to mention all the support families provide for each another?

        <br>
        While the concept of crabs in a bucket can help us to predict the negative outcomes of zero-sum thinking, it's important to remember that we are not crabs<sub>•</sub> And through recognising that others don't operate selfishly most of the time, hopefully we can exercise greater trust in one another.<sub>•</sub>
