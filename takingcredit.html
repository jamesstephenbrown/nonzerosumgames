            <p>"Knowledge is not a copy of reality<sub>•</sub> To know an object, to know an event, is not simply to look at it and make a mental copy or image of it<sub>•</sub> To know an object is to act on it<sub>•</sub> To know is to modify, to transform the object, and to understand the process of this transformation, and as a consequence to understand the way the object is constructed<sub>•</sub>" - Jean Piaget</p>

    <p>There's an interesting paradox, that in order to really adopt a new viewpoint from someone else, one actually has to be allowed to <a href="#footer">form that viewpoint themselves</a><sub>•</sub></p>
    <p><img src="./Images/Content/HH_Idea.png" alt="a lightbulb illuminating in a hedgehog's thought bubble"></p>
    <p>If Person A, for instance, provides a water-tight solution for some question but doesn't leave room for Person B to answer the question themselves, Person B might agree with Person A's conclusion, but it's unlikely they will internalise it<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p><img src="./Images/Content/HH_Sharing.png" alt="the hedgehog telling the idea to another hedgehog"></p>
    <p>Therefore it's important for Person A to leave space for Person B to form that thought themselves and adopt it as their own<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p><img src="./Images/Content/HH_ThinkingTogether.png" alt="thought bubbles combining"></p>
    <p>The paradox becomes evident when Person B, having made the logical connection themselves, fails to "give credit" to Person A for the idea<sub>•</sub> Because Person B has the sense that they formed that idea rather than adopting it from Person A<sub>•</sub></p>

    <p>SO<sub>•••</sub> this seems a bit unfair doesn't it? Or does it?<sub>•</sub> Let us know what you think in the comments below<sub>•</sub></p>

            <li>*The idea that a person must form concepts themselves rather than adopting them wholesale from others is a key feature of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/constructivism.html">Constructivism</a> which is a scientific theory in the field of Education and Psychology originally developed by Psychologist <a href="https://www.teach-nology.com/currenttrends/constructivism/piaget/#:~:text=Piaget's%20theory%20of%20constructivism%20argues,teaching%20methods%2C%20and%20education%20reform.">Jean Piaget</a> (quoted at the beginning)<sub>•</sub></li>
            <li>This is closely related to the popular idea of <a href="https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/drive/1smSpn4AiHSh8z7a0MHDBwhb_JhcoLQmI/2004-Prince_AL.pdf">Active Learning</a><sub>•</sub></li>

    <p>Okay, that was not actually the end of the blog, but imagine if it was - what would you have taken from it? What ideas have you come up with yourself?</p>
    <p>The reason I ask is that I considered finishing the blog at this point and leaving the conclusion up to you, the reader<sub>•</sub> But I was interested to see if you came to the same conclusion I did<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p><img src="./Images/Content/HH_Rabbit.png" alt="Rabbit having an idea"></p>
    <p>When I think about the issue of who deserves the credit, I have to ask, who has really done the work? Person A is getting to spread a message they want in the world (a reward in itself), what's more they don't have to change, or learn<sub>•</sub> Whereas Person B has changed their mind when faced with evidence and logic (no mean feat) and has taken on the cognitive load of making new connections in their brain<sub>•</sub></p>
    <h3>SO<sub>•••</sub></h3>
    <p>Perhaps Person B actually does deserve the credit that they <i><b>had</b></i> the idea themselves<sub>•</sub> I'd love to hear your ideas on the topic<sub>•</sub> If they differ from mine, that's interesting and if they do align with mine, then you will have concluded that <i><b>you</b></i> deserve the credit for that conclusion (and I agree)<sub>•</sub> So, either way, well done<sub>•</sub></p>
