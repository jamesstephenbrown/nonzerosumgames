            <p>
                After creating <a href="destroyingamanofwealthandtaste.html">my first NFTs</a> I noticed that NFT Collections were becoming very popular. These usually started with a base image with new elements and colours to create variations. I noticed this at the same time as I was realising something about art in general; that the art world doesn't actually reward originality, it rewards consistency. I got on to this line of thinking after seeing <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_thompson_the_four_letter_code_to_selling_anything">this TED Talk</a> about the importance of familiarity in the field of sales. These NFT collections were a manifestation of this approach to artistic consistency and it got me asking what were the possibilities of creating multiple variations from a very small amount of elements, cutting out originality almost altogether, and focusing completely on consistency.
            </p><p>
                I also thought it would be an interesting coding challenge to come up with a script that combines image elements to create every possible variation of a small set of image elements.

                The resulting artworks are the <a href="friendgibles.html">FRIENDGIBLES</a> and the NFT Creator I made to create them can be downloaded from its <a href="https://github.com/jamesstephenbrown/NFTCreator">GitHub Repository</a>. This is the first time I've posted something on GitHub to actually be used by other people so, apologies if it's not pretty. The basics are you have a set of folders in a particular structure (it must be correct for the files to land in the right place!) then you have a colorise script which colorises the elements and a combine script that combines the elements into unique images.
