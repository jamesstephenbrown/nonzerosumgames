    <p>Imagine you are given $10. To keep the money, you have to give a portion of this $10 away to another player. Sounds simple enough. Give the other player as little as possible. The catch is, if the other player rejects your offer, you both get nothing. This is the Ultimatum Game, a form of take-it-or-leave-it bargaining.</p>

    <h3>REARING ITS HEAD</h3>
    <p>The Ultimatum Game is a powerful game theory scenario because, despite its simplicity, it introduces a number of key concepts. Which is why it has appeared in numerous posts here at <a href="https://nonzerosum.games">nonzerosum.games</a>.</p>

    <img src="Images/Content/MoralLicensing_CatBrain.png" alt="The Ultimatum Game">

    <ul>
        <li>When exploring <a href="morallicensing2.html">Negative Moral Licensing</a>, we looked at <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201408/the-neuroscience-fairness-and-injustice" target="_blank">studies</a> that used The Ultimatum Game to understand human perceptions of injustice. The studies found that humans have an innate bias towards equitable treatment (for good evolutionary reasons).</li>

        <img src="Images/Content/Relative_CatsCash.png" alt="The Ultimatum Game">

        <li>In <a href="absolutevsrelative.html">Relative Gains</a> we asked what happens when the Ultimatum Game is played with counters, or real money, to draw attention to different approaches to games. Because fairness generally concerns relative value (between the players) it stands to reason that player two would demand an equal share, but when real money is involved, absolute value comes into play (in that the money has real value outside of the relative relationship between players) and so player two might be willing to take a smaller offer to gain real money.</li>

        <li>In Jaiveer Singh's <a href="subgameperfection.html">Subgame Purrrfection</a> the Ultimatum Game is used as an example of an <em>extensive form game</em> to illustrate subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium. Jaiveer explores how the game conflicts with commonly held norms around fairness and, like with the Prisoner's Dilemma, finds that these conflicts are mitigated with the introduction of <a href="repeatedgames.html">iterated games</a>.</li>

    <h3>REAL LIFE</h3>
    <p>As a freelancer, I deal with take it or leave it bargaining. I'll state my fee and if a producer accepts then I'll take the job, if not, I won't. But in a small industry often I'll take a lower offer if it's a relationship I want to maintain with someone I enjoy working with, so the dynamics of iterated games comes into play. Flexibility and acknowledgment of externalities (future jobs, a harmonious working environment) become (rational) factors.</p>

    <img src="Images/Content/MoralLicensing_CatAffection.png" alt="The Ultimatum Game">

    <h3>SO...</h3>
    <p>Ultimatum games are prevalent in our lives because, no matter how you slice it, every negotiation comes down to a final offer. It's where things get real, and so our behaviour when faced with an ultimatum reveals a lot about what we really want, and what motivates us. If you’ve been following our quest for a new <a href="https://nonzerosum.games/prisonersdilemma.html">poster-child</a> of game theory—one that captures the interplay of strategic rationality and human fairness—the Ultimatum Game is a prime candidate.</p>
