    <p>This 50th post marks the site's first birthday! Over the year we've covered <a href="index.html">many topics</a>, had <a href="whycooperate1.html">guest writers</a>, taken game theory <a href="nonzerothinkingforkids.html">out into the world</a>, and built a small community of people interested in exploring win-win solutions.</p>
    <p>During this time, many have remarked on the unique/odd/unserious/<i>illegible...</i> style of the site, and asked about how (and <b><i>why</b></i>) I've created it this way. So, this post draws back the curtain on what goes into making the site—focusing on <b><i>five creative principles</b></i> that can be applied to any creative discipline—principles built on more than 20 years experience as a creative professional.</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>But, before we get to them—how is a post about generating posts for the site relevant <b><i>to the site itself?</b></i></p>
    <a href="#RelatedMaterial"><img src="./Images/Content/Substrates_Brains.png" alt="Brains having a conversation"></a>
    
    <h3>IDEAS ARE NON-ZERO-SUM</h3>
    <p>As we earthlings develop, ever more opportunities arise to combine elements to create <b><i>wonders</b></i> that are greater than the sum of their parts. This is no more true than in our own minds. Ideas are accumulative and evolutionary—selected, combined and improved, with deleterious ideas replaced by "fitter" ones <i>(ideally)</i>. In developing ideas for the site I attempt to allow for new ideas to arise from unexpected places, and others to be... deleted <i>(hopefully before publication)</i>.</p>
    
    <p>This is a breakdown of my creative process, based creative principles more so than a tutorial on how to navigate the various technologies I use—but in saying that here's a quick map of the technical workflow.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_Workflow.png" øalt="A workflow diagram">

    <p>Let's explore how this works creatively.</p>

    <h3>1. CAST YOUR NET WIDE</h3>
    <p>While I consume media online just like anyone else, I think it's important to step outside the blogs, YouTube channels, and podcasts that have achieved algorithmic ascendancy if you want to produce original ideas.</p>
    
    <p>I read a lot of books in an undirected way—about things I think are valuable, timeless, and unappreciated. This often means reading classics, for instance, I've recently finished reading and notating 'Areopagitica', John Milton's 1644 case against censorship laws, the previous book was 'Piranesi' a contemporary story about someone inhabiting a psychological labyrinth, before that 'Wind and the Willows', before that 'Four Quartets' (a set of poems by T.S. Elliot) and 'Fall of The Aztecs'. You can expect references to these texts to appear in future posts.</p>
    
    <p>Reading in an undirected way provides unexpected and unique connections with those that are in the zeitgeist, and with the central ideas I'm developing—particularly when coupled with linked note-taking.</p>
    <img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_LinkedNotes.png"   class="blog_rounded_outlined" alt="Zoomed in notes graph">
    
    <h3>2. TAKE LINKED NOTES</h3>
    <p>Personal Knowledge Management systems (or PKMs) have become somewhat of a craze, no doubt in response to the firehose of information we're exposed to online. People need a way to process an amount of information for which our brains are not necessarily equipped...</p>
    <img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_Graph.png" class="blog_rounded_outlined" alt="Linked Notes Graph">
    
    <h3>OBSIDIAN</h3>
    <p>My creative process centers around the linked-notetaking app <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. For those who haven't experienced this form of note-taking, imagine basically your own personal Wikipedia with ideas through hyperlinks made by simply putting <b>[[double brackets around them]]</b>. Obsidian is free and has an active community creating plugins and providing highly detailed guides for harnessing the full potential of linking-your-thinking, but mine is pretty vanilla: I link notes, that is about it.</p><p>Using the local graph feature, it's easy to quickly discover related ideas, even when the link is initially tangential—reviewing these links often reveals the most interesting and unique insights<a href="#RelatedMaterial" style="text-decoration: none;">¥</a>.</p>
    <img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_LocalGraph.png" class="blog_rounded_outlined" alt="Screenshot of Obsidian, featuring Local Graph">
    
    <h3>3. SIGN YOUR WORK</h3>
    <p>Every artist needs a signature, an angle, a recognizable style. Now, I'm not an academic—I have <b><i>zero</b></i> authority on any topic outside art, but the blog covers a wide range of topics. So, I’ve designed the site with the phrase “These are just ideas from a random human, don’t reference me” in mind. I want people to feel free to discuss and question the ideas, to speculate and elaborate, bringing their own unique perspective. This doesn’t just apply to aesthetics, the content also needs consistency.</p>
    <p>For many who thrive on novelty, reading widely can feel very natural—but this can become a liability when focus is required. If people wanted something random every day, the online world could serve that up without you. I've found having a consistent offering is important.</p>

<p>This site's focus is on non-zero-sum games and how to best understand them in the real world—to create a brighter future. That's the lens each post uses to explore a different issue each week.</p>
<h3>COMBINE NOTES</h3>
<p>Topics for the blog arise when the unique insights from wide reading and linked note-taking collide with the site's focus.</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_Venn.png" alt="A venn diagram showing the intersection of wide reading, linked notes and core theme.">

<p>For instance, when I was studying artificial intelligence, I discovered a consensus around what's called the coordination problem that stems from a zero-sum mentality—an assumption that individual interests must always be at the expense of the collective. This was an issue I hadn't seen explored from this perspective, and it became the concept behind <a href="alignment1.html">The Alignment Problem No One Is Talking About</a>. A blog idea becomes a note with links to any relevant notes, I store that in a Blog Ideas note, and when I'm ready to develop it, I schedule it in a Content Calendar note, it's notes all the way down.</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/Alignment_Scale.png" alt="A Rabbit looking through a magnifying glass at earth">

<h3>4. INTERROGATE</h3>
<p>Once I've outlined and drafted a post, I interrogate the claims, checking for scientific studies to confirm or negate them and finding evocative case studies.</p>

<p>For instance in <a href="crabbucket.html">Are You a Crab in a Bucket?</a>, I used the Hillsborough Disaster as a real-world analogy, or in the <a href="conwaysgame.html">Emergence Series</a>, I discovered my original concept was missing an important ingredient: <a href="emergencevsentropy.html#DissipativeStructures">dissipative structures</a>. Other times I'll find out my assumptions were just plain incorrect... in which case I'll have to fabricate evidence, bribe scientists or blackmail administrators in order to maintain my original position (or if that's too much effort, I'll just ditch the idea).</p>

<p>Once I have a good draft down, I'll make a list of illustrations and interactive elements.</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_Critters.png" alt="A group of critters">
<h3>THE FUN STUFF</h3>
<p>As well as the unserious font and colorful background, I draw cartoon critters that are thematically related to the post. These are drawn with an Apple Pencil on an iPad Pro using <a href="https://procreate.com/" target="_blank">Procreate</a> (the standard studio pen, if you're interested).</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_DrawingBoard.png" class="blog_rounded_outlined" alt="Screenshot of Tools">
<p>I use a long page, 1000px wide, with space enough to fit all the drawings for a post.</p>
<blockquote>
<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_Drawings.png" alt="A series of drawing pages">

<p>... and I draw in layers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Black lines</li>
    <li>White areas</li>
    <li>Shadows</li>
    <li>Colors</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I export to Photoshop, clear the background and crop each illustration, maintaining a uniform width, then export as a .png file.</p>

<h3>THE SIMS</h3>
<p>I also love coding, and often use simulations to illustrate systems. Here I must shout out to the incredible <a href="https://ncase.me" target="_blank">Nicky Case</a>, who I've drawn inspiration from when it comes to both the tone of the site and use of interactive elements—though Nicky is a far superior coder.</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_NickyCase.png" alt="Iteration diagram">

<p>When I first saw Nicky's site I felt a very particular sort of panic that only occurs when you see someone doing something you didn't realize you've wanted to do all your life, while also being in reverent fear of how well they are doing it. Needless to say, it was a motivator to put pen to proverbial paper.</p>

<h3>5. ITERATE</h3>
<p>I do illustrations relatively early, as I use them to break up the text visually. Doing this, I find myself making edits to the text for clarity, for a cleaner aesthetic, or I'll cut text entirely and let the illustration do the work.</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_Iteration.png" alt="Iteration diagram">

<p>Continuing to edit the content throughout the process provides me with different lenses to better understand what I'm writing.</p>

<blockquote>
    "Writing is thinking, to write well is to think clearly, that's why it's so hard"<br>- double Pulitzer Prize winner <b>David McCullough</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing <i>is</i> thinking, but so is drawing, so is outlining, so is coding, so is formatting as html—at each stage, opportunities to make the work clearer, sharper and more engaging reveal themselves.</p>

<h3>FEEDBACK</h3>
<p>As a documentary editor for 20 years, I'm used to taking feedback. My job is to do something wrong over and over—each time making changes based on director feedback—until it is no-longer-wrong, at which point it is finished.</p>
<blockquote>
   "The only wisdom we can hope to acquire
    Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless." - <b>T.S Elliot</b> (Four Quartets...)
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to writing I'll often seek feedback from a friend or family member. I'll even made changes based on feedback <b><i>after</b></i> publication, especially in the case of factual errors or easily misinterpreted phrases.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_ChatGPT.png" alt="Chat GPT Picture">
<h3>DO I USE CHAT GPT?</h3>
<p>While I don't use Chat to write content, I do use it to find poorly clarified or unsupported points and once I've finished editing, I'll give it an html template of a previous post along with the new content and patiently cajole it to format the content according to the model.</p>

<h3>BONUS TIP: REPEAT... OVER AND OVER AGAIN</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
    "The real artist ships" - <b>Pablo Picasso</b>
</blockquote>

<p>The most basic creative advice, which is so easy to forget is to simply <b><i>do the work</b></i>, and then to do the work all over again. Campbell Walker (a.k.a Struthless), in his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE" target="_blank">The Drawing Advice That Changed My Life</a>, tells the story of his mentor critiquing Walker's scattered approach to creativity—starting a million projects but never finishing. At the time I had thousands of scattered notes, a 30,000-word experimental, non-linear essay, twenty-odd <a href="https://nonzerosum.itch.io/" target="_blank">proof-of-concept simulation</a>s, some mobile games, a neglected Facebook sketching page, some random <a href="https://nonzerosum.games/empireofidols.html">paintings</a> I was trying to house, not to mention numerous planning spreadsheets, lists and workflows—it got so bad that, at one point, I was coding three entirely different bespoke planning apps!</p>

<p>Walker's mentor could have easily been addressing me... the advice was simple.</p>

<blockquote>
    "Draw the same thing every single day" - Mark Schattner
</blockquote>

<p>Setting a requirement to produce a blog each week, has been the keystone to building this site, it has brought everything into focus. And I encourage you, whatever your version of <b><i>drawing the same thing every day</b></i> is, try doing it for six months. It might change your life.</p>

<img src="./Images/Content/CreativePrinciples_RabbitsCake.png" alt="Two rabbits sitting either side of a birthday cake">

<h3>SO</h3>
<p>Creating work regularly requires making a choice and sticking to it, but I find the principles detailed here can contribute greatly to generating the consistent and coherent stream of content necessary to achieve that.</p>

<p>Reading widely brings originality, linking-notes transforms information into concepts, combining those concepts with your own personal focus makes your work unique and recognizable, interrogating the work keeps you honest and trustworthy and constant iteration at each stage enables the essence of the work to reveal itself.</p>

<p>I hope this post has helped give an idea of what goes into a seemingly simple post, and has provided some useful ideas for your own creative endeavours—feel free to link to whatever <i><b>you're</b></i> working on in the comments or share your own creative insights.</p>
