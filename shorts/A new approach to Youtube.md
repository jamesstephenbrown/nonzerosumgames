There is a way in which the medium of [[Youtube]] is becoming less about celebrity and more about conversation - a designed conversation, where you can edit out your ums, and make sure you’re communicating what you actually mean.

It's like [[Drawing a picture with words]].

Youtube has been around for 15 years now and there has been an outgrowth of open-ended, designed and considered, conversation. For many it’s intellectual entertainment, and even company, but it is something new, like the postal service, the printing press, or the telephone. Letters enabled a different form conversation with a different pace and intensity, youtube has enabled a richer more designed conversation which can be more proportionate, clear, and engaging. It feels like it could help shift progress in a positive direction.

Of course there is a negative side to this, and many anti-social groups can used the medium, which is why I don’t see the proliferation of content as a negative, why I don’t see that because zefrank, [[Vlog Brothers]] or [[ViHart]] have done something already that these new formats and genres of youtube conversation shouldn’t be built upon. In fact we should want to crowd out the negative, anti-science anti-social elements. I have a deep respect for experts, so I will always try to reference any statements in the comments and will point to experts where ever I can, and where topics involve people in different demographics I will point to people who can comment from experience.
