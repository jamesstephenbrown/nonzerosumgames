By [[Yuval Noah Harari]]

He continues his case that humans follow stories rather than facts, stating that global elites formulated three [[Grand Narratives]] in the 20th century, the Fascist, Communist and Liberal stories. With the first two being overthrown respectively in [[WWII]] and with the fall of [[The Berlin Wall]] leaving only liberal democracy and [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s premature pronouncement of ***the end of history***.

He illustrates the antithesis of the liberal (ideally [[Non-Zero-Sum Games|non-zero-sum]]) project by illustrating someone locked in a *selfish* revulsion at inequity.

"I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster wife. I cannot read, and therefore wish all books were burnt. I am lean with seeing others eat. O, that there would come a famine through all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! Then thou should'st see how fat I would be. But must thou sit and I stand? Come down, with a vengeance."â€”Christopher Marlowe, Doctor Faustus
