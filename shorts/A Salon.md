I've always flirted with the idea of being part of an intellectual forum. In the art room we had [[Cafe Society]] which was based on Cafe Central, a Viennese hub where many luminaries and villains of the early 20th Century, from Freud to Hitler, discussed their plans. In history groups such as these have been highly consequential, such as the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] and [[The Edinburgh Review]]

I have also had forays into these sort of intellectual collaborations, for example with [[Andy]] with his website ThinkOrDie, or the atheist facebook group Secularists, Infidels and Non-Believers (S.I.N) I set up with Sarah. We are continuing this traditon with the [[Untitled Podcast]].

I would like to connect with others in the same collaborative way on [[nonzerosum.games]].
