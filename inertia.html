    <p>Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if you hadn't been born? Would an entirely different person have taken your place? How about if humans had never emerged? Could another species have evolved higher levels of intelligence instead of us? How about if life, as we know it, didn't emerge—could some life-form, based on entirely different fundamental chemicals, have arisen in our place?</p>

    <p>This post explores ways of questioning our collective perspective of the world—interrogating some real world <i><b>accidents of history</b></i> that might be reevaluated.</p>

    <h2>THE FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE</h2>
    <p>We will never know if things could have been vastly different, because our existence precludes the existence of alternative humans, species, or life-forms, simply because we were here first. In marketing, this is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage" target="_blank">first mover advantage</a>, and we see it play out in the survival of products, with new innovations being out-competed, absorbed into larger companies, or just never attempted (due to the seeming inevitability of their failure).</p>
    <img src="Images/Content/Unlocking_Desk.png" alt="a rabbit at a desk">

    <h2>THE ARROW OF HISTORY</h2>
    <p>We can often take the current state of the world as an inevitable product of the arrow of history. Thinkers like Robert Wright see increasing <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html">non-zero-sumness</a> as the universal direction, while fatalism takes inevitability to an extreme, asserting that if the clock were wound back, it would play out exactly the same way.</p>
    
    <p>As an agnostic determinist, I take the perspective that <a href="https://nonzerosum.games/conwaysgame.html">emergence</a> is the determining factor in the progress of life, allowing for many different paths to emerge from the same initial conditions. From this perspective, things <i>could</i> be very different. But one thing we generally agree on is causality. When it comes to questioning such assumptions we turn to science fiction.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "We experienced events in an order, and perceived their relationship as cause and effect. They [the alien septopods] experienced all events at once, and perceived a purpose underlying them all." - <b>Louise Banks</b> (A Story Of Your Life)
    </blockquote>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_Semagram.png" alt="A semagram from the movie Arrival"></p>

    <h2>ARRIVAL</h2>
    <p>Ted Chiang's short story "A Story of Your Life"—the basis for the movie "Arrival", plays out in a deterministic universe, where reality, when reframed through the alien septopods' point of view, is circular, and causality is time-independent. Though it is a deterministic world, it is a very different world, helping us to imagine how much our conception of reality is contingent on our anthropocentric perspective.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that future..." - <b>Louise Banks</b> (A Story Of Your Life)
    </blockquote>

    <p>This circular conception of determinism is reflected in the septopods' language, and it is through the linguist Louise Banks' communication, using this language, that she begins to understand their conception of reality. While questioning our assumptions of causality, Chiang also asks how language shapes perception.</p>

    <h2>SEMAGRAMS</h2>
    <p>In contrast to the linear progression of words from left to right in alphabetical languages like English, the septopods use two-dimensional space to arrange linguistic elements depending on the relationship of the words. The story's protagonist Louise Banks explains that in a semagram...</p>

    <blockquote>
        "... a noun is identified as subject or object based on the orientation of its logogram relative to that of the verb." - Louise (A Story Of Your Life)
    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Could we reassess the linear progression of written text?</em></p>

    <h2>LOGOGRAMS 2.0</h2>
    <p>To an English speaker, logographic languages like Chinese Hanzi or Japanese Kanji provide an insight into how words can be represented non-linearly. Semagrams go further, with the capacity to represent the meaning of entire sentences in immediately understandable symbols.</p>

    <p><em>What would it look like to do this using English words?</em></p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_EnglishSemagrams.png" alt="A semagram from English words"></p>

    <p>Chiang draws the analogy to mathematical notation, where we use spatial representation to better represent complex abstract concepts and their relationships.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "I bet you that learning their two-dimensional grammar will help you when it comes time to learn their mathematical notation." - <b>Gary Donnelly</b> (A Story Of Your Life)
    </blockquote>

    <p>While a wholesale reevaluation of linear written text might be a non-starter, we do already use two-dimensional layouts, in the form of checklists, outlines, and mind-maps, or in the nested tab layout coders use. Could we utilize these, or other devices, to further enhance reading? For instance, very complicated sentences could be simplified and expanded when necessary, like this:</p>

   <blockquote> 
<div class="outline">
    </style>

    <details>
        <summary>You could imagine a sentence</summary>
        <details>
            <summary>with many embedded clauses</summary>
            <details>
                <summary>which are essentially clarifications</summary>
                <details>
                    <summary>that could be omitted</summary>

                        <details>
                            <summary>on the part of the reader</summary>
                            <section>of such grammatical mechanisms</section>

        </details>
    </details>
    <section><span style="margin-left: 20px">might make more sense when clearly outlined.</span></section>
</div>
</blockquote>

    <p>This is a silly example, as it's unnecessarily over-complicated, and I do recognize that authorship plays an important role in determining the focus of a sentence. But, some forms of non-linear text are becoming commonplace; web links, and the integration of linked-thinking in note-taking apps like Obsidian—integrating an additional dimension of detail within text. Considering this evolution of language in this way might prompt us to ask...</p>

    <p><em>Should we go back to the drawing board and question the fundamental underpinnings of language? And what else might we question?</em></p>


    <h2>FIRST PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <p>In order to break out of their biases, philosophers will attempt to return to first principles—stripping away knowledge that is based on <a href="https://nonzerosum.games/itssubjective.html" target="_blank">subjectivity</a>, assumptions, or metaphor, in order to get to ground truth, and then build up new frameworks of understanding from more solid foundations. This is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundationalism" target="_blank">Foundationalism</a>.</p>

    <h2>BUILDING FICTION FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <p>Ted Chiang takes this approach when writing. In "A Story of Your Life" he stripped away assumptions about time and causality, and then, for the purposes of science fiction, switched assumptions at the base to create a world where causality is not contingent on linear time.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Alignment_HumanitysPlan.png" alt="A dvorak keyboard"></p>

    <h2>RISKY BUSINESS</h2>
    <p>Now, going back to first principles can be fraught, for this very reason—it is easy, once you've stripped away all the 'common sense' accumulated by humanity over millennia, to accidentally insert a <em><strong>flawed</strong></em> assumption at the base, and build up a model, from that foundation, which magnifies the flaw in its conception to develop a radically flawed worldview. I actually think Descartes, the <em>founder</em> of Foundationalism, fell into this trap—a story for another time.</p>

    <p>Bearing in mind the potential pitfalls, let's explore some historical accidents that might be remedied with the benefit of hindsight.</p>


    <h2>DVORAK</h2>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_DvorakKeys.png" alt="A dvorak keyboard"></p>

    <p>Those that know me (or have had the misfortune of sharing a work computer with me) will know I use a keyboard layout that scrambles ordinary typing into absolute gibberish. It's called 'Dvorak' and is apparently more ergonomic than the standard QWERTY keyboard.</p>


    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_QwertyKeys.png" alt="A QWERTY keyboard"></p>

    <p>The story goes that the QWERTY layout was designed so that neighbouring keys wouldn't be pressed in sequence, to avoid key-jamming in early typewriters. Once the jamming issue was resolved by improved mechanical methods, some proposed that the layout should be changed to be better for typing comfort and speed. However, at this point in time, 500 units had already been sold, and therefore the company decided against changing the layout and causing customer confusion. 100 years later and we have billions of keyboards sporting an inefficient layout that gives everyone RSI.</p>

    <p>This (potentially apocryphal) story illustrates how, through accident of history, the first mover advantage can result in a suboptimal design gaining global dominance.</p>

    <h2>LOCAL MINIMA & MAXIMA</h2>
    <p>The QWERTY keyboard layout is an example of a local maxima, which exists due to the inertia of history. A local maxima is where an option is much better than its neighboring options, but is not the optimal choice.</p>
    <p><img src="Images/Content/NotRealGraphs_LocalMaximaMinima.png" alt="Graph showing local maxima and minima"></p>
    <p>People have learned to type using QWERTY, computers are configured with it by default, and keyboard shortcuts are associated with those keys. So, deviation from this norm comes at a cost—I know, I've been using Dvorak for 20 years, and even today I run into friction. This comes in the form of confused coworkers trying to use my computer, or apps that don't use layout-independent keyboard shortcuts, or, when I am forced to use a QWERTY keyboard and I look like someone who's just learning to type.</p>

    <p>In order to get to the optimal solution, one has to traverse negative terrain. In the case of the dvorak keyboard layout being universally adopted, this is unlikely to be terrain that will ever be crossed by society at large, but where masochistic individuals like myself might find the typing comfort, and the nerd value, to be worth it.</p>

    <h2>IS THE DECIMAL SYSTEM A LOCAL MAXIMUM?</h2>
    <p>One area which I believe is a local maximum is also probably the least tractable of all systems: the decimal system.</p>

    <p><i>But why do we even use the decimal system?</i></p>

    <p>A naive answer to why we have a decimal (base 10) counting system could be that we have ten fingers... and the naive answer turns out to be the <strong>actual</strong> answer. The decimal system was developed arbitrarily based on the number of fingers we have. The greatest mathematicians on earth are using a system that prioritizes the teaching of finger-counting to pre-schoolers.</p>

    <h2>OTHER BASES</h2>
    <p>Humans have toyed with other counting systems through history—base 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 60—and few of these are particularly interesting.</p>

    <h3>VIGESIMAL (Base 20)</h3>
    <p>When Abe Lincoln orated "Four score and seven," he was making reference to a biblical vigesimal (base 20) counting system for rhetorical effect. Many societies have used a base 20 system through history—for instance, the French word for 80 is "quatre-vingts," meaning four-twenties, while the Mayans and Aztecs used a sophisticated base 20 calendar and number system represented with dots and bars.</p>

    <h3>SEXAGESIMAL (Base 60)</h3>
    <p>The Sumerian and Babylonian sexagesimal system, which developed around 3000 BCE, coincided with (and contributed to) advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and time-keeping. Its legacy is evident in how we measure time (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour) and angles (360 degrees in a circle). Sexagesimal benefits from being highly divisible, with 12 factors.</p>

    <h3>DUODECIMAL (Base 12)</h3>
    <p>One of the key factors in the utility of a number system is how easily it is divided. Another highly divisible number, which is closer to our counting norm, is 12. There is a good argument to be made that Duodecimal (base 12) is a superior system to decimal. It is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 (that's 3 factor pairs, as opposed to decimal's 2). 12 is also a factor of 60, making many mathematical operations with base 12 much simpler than they are with decimal.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_FactorsOf12.png" alt="Pebbles showing the factors of 12"></p>

    <h2>BINARY (Base 2)</h2>
    <p>The rise of computation has brought with it systems based on binary, because the transistors in computers act as switches between 'off' or 'on' (0 or 1).</p>

    <p>This underlying binary framework is why numbers associated with computers are commonly powers of 2: 32 or 64-bit operating systems, 8 bits in a byte, 1024 bytes in a "kilobyte." RAM and Graphics capacity is commonly 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. But, while binary is perfect for computers, it is unworkable as a human-level mathematical framework because it is far too verbose. 1,024 in decimal equates to 10000000000 in binary.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_HexadecimalSquare.png" alt="Pebbles showing the factors of 16"></p>

    <h2>HEXADECIMAL (THE BEST OPTION)</h2>
    <p>I would make the case that the best option is <strong>Hexadecimal</strong> (base 16), which has risen to prominence in the era of computers because of its compatibility with binary. It's is used in computer science when binary values need to be readable by humans, allowing for perfectly aligned compression of binary values. 10 in hexadecimal is equivalent to 10000 in binary (16 in decimal), and 100 in hexadecimal is equivalent to 100000000 in binary (or 256 in decimal). Hexadecimal values are used in web colors, where each channel has 256 potential values (0-255 or in hexadecimal 0-FF). The value for white in hexadecimal is FFFFFF, which is equivalent to 11111111 11111111 11111111 in binary.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_HexadecimalStructure.png" alt="Pebbles showing the factors of 16"></p>
    

    <h2>WHAT WOULD BE SIMPLER WITH HEXADECIMAL?</h2>
    <p>Having a system that aligns with binary will make computer-based math and programming easier and more efficient. 16 is also more divisible than 10. Like duodecimal, it has 3 factor pairs as opposed to 2 in decimal. It is also a square number, which gives it other mathematically useful properties and, in some ways, makes it easier to learn.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_HexadecimalFactors.png" alt="Pebbles showing the factors of 16"></p>

    <h2>WHAT WOULD BE HARDER WITH HEXADECIMAL?</h2>
    <p>Learning hexadecimal would require students to learn 16 different numerical symbols (currently, 10-15 in decimal are represented by A-F), which might be difficult but is possible, given that English speakers remember the order of 26 letters of the alphabet.</p>
    
    <p>The intuitivenss of decimal system when it comes to finger-counting also shouldn't be discounted. A low barrier to entry for students learning maths might be more important than a more useful counting system. However, lying wide awake one night, I conceived of away to finger-count to 16 using your thumbs as a switch.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Inertia_FingerCounting.png" alt="Image of finger counting to 16"></p>


    <p>You might almost call it intuitive given we technically have <i>8</i> fingers and 2 thumbs.</p>

    <h2>THE INDIVIDUAL VS THE COLLECTIVE</h2>
    <p>When I wonder whether I should begin teaching my daughter hexadecimal arithmetic, I run into the same issue I did with Dvorak. While it might be best for humanity to collectively adopt hexadecimal, it's an uphill battle for an individual in a population who does not. Other than building mental skills, hexadecimal knowledge might actually confuse her use of decimal at school, like when I go back to typing on a QWERTY keyboard.</p>

    <p><img src="Images/Content/Alignment_CollectiveIndividuals.png" alt="Image of the collective"></p>


    <h2>THESE ARE ALL COORDINATION PROBLEMS</h2>
    <p>In any problem where the collective is using a sub-optimal system, it will be very difficult for an individual to overcome collective inertia. This is something we've covered in <a href="unlockingsolutions.html">Unlocking Solutions</a>, where we discussed coordination problems—like pins in a lock, if all are not aligned in unison, no progress is possible.</p>


    <p><img src="Images/Content/Unlocking_Locks.png" alt="A diagram of a lock"></p>

    <h2>COUNTER ARGUMENTS</h2>
    <p>There may be areas where local maxima—whether it be a keyboard layout, counting system, language, product monopoly, or dominant species—might preclude the development of the <b><i>best</i></b> solution. However, there are plenty of examples of where this is not the case and reasons why the optimal solution might, paradoxically, not turn out to be the best option.</p>

    <h2>CONVERGENT EVOLUTION</h2>
    <p>When different paths with different initial genetics and environments lead to the same outcome, this is called convergent evolution. Eyes, for instance, are said to have independently evolved more than 20 times. If a solution has enough utility, nature (in the words of another sci-fi icon) <em>"finds a way."</em></p>

    <h2>START-UPS</h2>
    <p>In terms of the 'First Mover Advantage' in marketing, there is also a counterpoint where smaller companies <strong>can</strong> thrive because they exist in smaller (less visible) niches. The phenomenon of tech start-ups is an example of how innovation often happens outside of the tech behemoths, because those behemoths are victim to their own form of inertia.</p>

    <h2>GOODHART'S LAW</h2>
    <p>There is another reason not to get too hung up on the optimal solution, and that is <a href="goodhartslaw.html">Goodhart's Law</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
    </blockquote>

    <p>If we focus too much on finding a technically optimal solution, we may find that we compromise unappreciated features of a "sub-optimal" solution. Goodhart's Law calls for a satisficing approach that looks to optimize for a range of relevant measures rather than a single metric—my short excursion into re-structuring English showed an immediate lack of appreciation for the complexity of language enabled by our current linear sentence structure.</p>

    <h2>SO...</h2>
    <p>In many respects, history is written by the victors, and the first mover has a strong influence on the progression of history. While humanity might, through evolution, eventually end up with optimal solutions, it's worth occasionally standing back and asking: <strong>could things be different, and could they be better?</strong> In many of his stories Ted Chiang questions our assumptions and inserts new ones to create thought provoking science fiction, reminding us that our assumption can be questioned. Whether you're looking at a more ergonomic keyboard, your system of government, your career, or your personal life, asking "did I choose this?" or "is it another accident of history?" might just enable us to change our lives for the better.</p>
