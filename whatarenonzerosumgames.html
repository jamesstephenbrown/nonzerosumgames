    <img src="./Images/Content/Lifes_A_Game.png" alt="A Rhinoceros Beetle saying Life's a Game">

    <p>As the saying goes, life is a game, or rather a series of games<sub>•</sub> From the genetic lottery we're thrown into at birth, to the educational opportunities we navigate, the jobs we compete for, and the relationships we cultivate - every stage is marked by wins and losses, strategies and tactics, alliances, and competition<sub>•</sub> But not all games are zero-sum showdowns<sub>•</sub> To understand <strong><i>non</i>-zero-sum<i>ness</i></strong> it helps to consider "sum" different types of <i>games</i><sub>•</sub></p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="lightColumn">
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>zero-sum games</li>
                <li>positive-sum games</li>
                <li>negative-sum games</li>

            </ul>

    <h3>ZERO-SUM GAMES</h3>
    <p><sub>•••</sub> are where two parties compete and in order for one party to win the other must lose<sub>•</sub> The positive payoff for the winner in such a game requires an equally negative payoff for the loser, so that the sum of the payoff is zero, hence "zero-sum"<sub>•</sub> Chess is as zero-sum game because players can't both win or both lose, so is soccer<sub>•••</sub> or competitive eating<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>There are also lots of <i>common sense</i> sayings that echo zero-sum thinking - "You don't get something for nothing" or "you get what you pay for" "you can't have your cake and eat it too"<sub>•</sub> Like any well-designed memes, these sayings have survived because in many situations they are confirmed by experience, but not always<sub>•</sub></p>
        
    <p>With <strong><i>non</i></strong>-zero-sum games, while you may not get something for nothing, the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts<sub>•</sub></p>


    <h3>POSITIVE-SUM GAMES</h3>
    <p><sub>•••</sub> are non-zero-sum games which result in win-win scenarios<sub>•</sub> Imagine two card collectors who each have <i>doubles</i> of cards that the other doesn't have<sub>•</sub> Swapping their doubles leaves both closer to completing their collection<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>This kind of game is generally what people (and this website) mean when talking about a non-zero-sum game<sub>•</sub> </p>

        <p>Later on we'll get to an example where the stakes are slightly higher than an incomplete card collection<sub>•</sub></p>
    <h3>NEGATIVE-SUM GAMES</h3>
    <p><sub>•••</sub> are another type of non-zero-sum game, the flip-side of positive-sum games where both sides lose<sub>•</sub> Like a bar-room brawl with even odds, there are just going to be a lot of injuries and property damage<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>Identifying negative-sum games (and avoiding them) can often be as beneficial as taking part in positive-sum games<sub>•</sub></p>

    <h3>AN EXAMPLE FROM NATURE</h3>
    <p>Interestingly, nature has found ways around negative-sum games, by animals evolving behaviours or physical attributes that are demonstrative of dominance, rather than having to physically fight one another<sub>•</sub> Take for instance those weird horned beetles you've seen, the Hercules or Rhinoceros Beetle or the Stag Beetle with its over-sized mandibles<sub>•</sub> Not only does the "size of their horn" matter for sexual selection, but also for asserting dominance over competitive males without the need for physical conflict<sub>•</sub></p>
        
    <img src="./Images/Content/Hercules_Beetles.png" alt="Hercules Beetles avoiding a fight">
        
        <p>In fact even when they fight, these beetles do so without injury, generally by flipping their opponent off whatever branch they're on<sub>•</sub></p>


    <p>Humans also take part in elaborate exercises that help us steer clear of conflict<sub>•</sub> Imagine the wars we've avoided by having a small group of elite sports people compete for the pride of their nation<sub>•</sub> And more explicitly, the acknowledgement of "Mutually Assured Destruction" has so far played a key role in avoiding the very negative-sum game of thermo-nuclear war<sub>•</sub></p>
    
    </div></div>
    
    <h3>META-GAMES</h3>
    <p><sub>•••</sub> are games which are embedded in wider games, meaning that zero-sum games can become part of larger non-zero-sum systems<sub>•</sub> This is where we venture away from the well-bounded world of Game Theory into the messy real world, and things get really interesting<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>It's sport analogy time!!!<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>The 'SOUP-A-BOWL' is an international soup-eating competition<sub>•</sub> The competition is a winner-takes-all game between the competitive-eating elite from across the globe, a very zero-sum game<sub>•</sub> But surrounding the game is an entire industry made up of<sub>•••</sub></p>
    
    
    <div class="container">
        <div class="lightColumn">
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fans - who pay to get entertainment that they find more valuable than the cost of the ticket</li>
        <li>A Stadium - who gets more from ticket sales than the cost associated with the event</li>
        <li>Competitors - who get to eat all they want and enjoy the prestige of representing their country</li>
        <li>Sponsors - who get exposure for their products while also competing to make the most entertaining adverts that are eagerly anticipated by fans as part of the spectacle<sub>•</sub></li>
    </ul>
    </div></div>
    <p>At each meta-level of the competition there are accumulative win-win (positive-sum) games, transforming a zero-sum game into a whole non-zero-sum system<sub>•</sub></p>

<p>
    <img src="./Images/Content/Not_Crab_Soup.png" alt="A bowl of not-crab soup"></p>

    <p>So in essense, non-zero-sum games are any situation where a positive payoff for a winner doesn't necessarily require an equally negative payoff for the loser<sub>•</sub> Non-zero-sum games are interactions that can be positive for everyone (a positive-sum game) or conversely, negative for all parties (a negative-sum game)<sub>•</sub> But most interestingly, understanding "non-zero-sumness" can help us look at the complex multi-layered (meta-games) that arise in our everyday lives, so we can better decide which games to create and play and which we might prefer to avoid<sub>•</sub></p>
