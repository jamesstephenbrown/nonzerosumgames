The utilitarian, given enough time, would also conclude the consequences of murdering hospital visitors would be far worse than the fate of 5 patients. So, I would contest that Utilitarianism is the best way to evaluate ethical decisions, but it can also be used to develop robust virtue ethics systems, which may prove more useful in the moment. With time to contemplate, I favour John Stuart Mill's Preference Utilitarianism, which goes some way to addressing the diversity of preferred experiences as extended from the simplistic pleasure / pain spectrum.<br></p>
