    <p>Ever noticed that the first slice of pizza is always the best and each slice afterwards never quite matches up?</p>

    <p>Welcome to the <b>Law of Diminishing Returns</b>, a principle from economics which holds that as investment increases, returns diminish relative to the investment<sub>•</sub> Tap the graph below to see various diminishing return scenarios.<sub>•</sub></p>

    <p>The black line represents return-on-investment. The <span style="color:#fff021">linear growth line</span> shows what it'd look like if returns equaled investment (costs). As you can see the returns begin well, <span style="color:#3aff4a">returning more than the cost</span> but at a point they <span style="color:#ff3a6e">fall below costs</span><sub>•</sub>
    </p>

    <p>When it comes to <b>Happiness and Wealth</b>, we can take our friend Mr<sub>•</sub> F<sub>•</sub> Cat, he's the one who's full of pizza. Fat Cat loves cars, and gets immense joy from furnishing his garage with gleaming supercars like a feline Jay Leno<sub>•••</sub> to begin with, but at a certain point each shiny new automobile adds less joy than the last<sub>•</sub> He ponders to himself, how can I make more joy? Then he spots Mr<sub>•</sub> A<sub>•</sub> Cat and has an idea<sub>•</sub>

</p>
    <p>Now, this act of generosity does little to dent Fat Cat's happiness (remember, diminishing returns), but for Alley Cat, who has never owned anything more than a box, this gift is a game-changer<sub>•</sub> It's a total positive-sum game!<sub>•</sub></p>
   
<div class="container">
    <div class="lightColumn">
        <p>Added-Joy = (Life-changing joy from the car to Alley Cat) - (Diminished joy from the car for Fat Cat)<sub>•</sub></p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>And here's the kicker - this act doesn't just make Alley Cat happier, because happiness is itself <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html">non-zero-sum</a>, it's contagious - making someone else happier, makes you happier too<span style="color:#ffffff"><span title="See 'Related Material' for evidence"><sup>*</sup></span></span><sub>•</sub></p>

<h3>SO<sub>•••</sub></h3>
<p>What's the lesson in this tale of two cats? The law of diminishing returns isn't just a law; it's an opportunity<sub>•</sub> It's an invitation to redistribute what we have in excess to those who will benefit the most from it, optimising joy for all<sub>•</sub> Who knew economics could be so warm and fuzzy?</p>
<p>Purr-fect<sub>•</sub></p>
