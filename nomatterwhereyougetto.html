  <h1 id="title">NO MATTER WHERE YOU GET TO, THERE YOU ARE</h1><aside>m</aside><h2 id="subtitle">a funny story that wasn't so funny at the time</h2>
<p>
	<em>After some feedback that people would like to hear some more stories, I thought I'd mix it up a little this week. The following story is all true, and is adapted from a speech I entered in our local Toastmasters Humorous Speech Competition (and won!).</em>
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever heard of the saying <b>"No matter where you go, there you are"</b>? Throughout my life, I've experienced this as meaning that whatever trappings of success I achieve, whatever signifiers of status I attain, it won't eliminate my internal flaws—they exist independently of achieving my goals, so I better either face them directly or get comfortable with them. I feel like a better formulation is the subtly different…
</p>
<blockquote>
	No matter where you <strong><em>get to</em></strong> , there your are.
</blockquote>
<p>
	The following story embodies this notion. It happened only recently, but it all began many years ago, with a series of crappy cars, and a cosmetic compulsion…
</p>
<p>
	To put this is context, I'm from a small town in New Zealand, where, as a teenager, the factor that determined your success on <strong><em>the streets</em></strong> was… your car. Whether you had one, how much noise its exhaust pipe made, and whether it had a subwoofer. My exhaust was silent and I had no subwoofer because I didn't own a car.
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_BoyRacer.png" alt="a boy racer in a CRX">
<p>
	We got our <em>first</em> car in my early 20s—my wife's old family van, for a steal: $700… every 6 months at warrant time. It was a rust-bucket. It was what you might charitably call a "work in progress". It was a real dunger. I would bore out the large corroded holes, bog them, sand them and carefully apply three layers of perfectly matched silver spray paint.
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Dunger.png" alt="A rusty old van">
<p>
	A friend once asked…
</p>
<blockquote>
	"Mate, that's not structural rust, is it? Are you doing this for… cosmetic reasons?"
</blockquote>
<p>
	… the implication being, if I was interested in looks, why was I driving an 88 Toyota Liteace? But my answer was "<b>yes</b>"… it <i>was</i> for cosmetic reasons.
</p>
<p>
	Needless to say, the van didn't last long, and it would be years before we would next need a car to go house-hunting. I remember being asked "James, you're buying a house in Auckland, why are you driving around in a 25 year old Festiva?". My reply was defiant.
</p>
<blockquote>
	Oh, just you wait, <strong><em>Mum</em></strong> . One day, I'm going to have the perfect car.
</blockquote>
<p>
	I restored dignity to the Festiva—touching-up the paint work with nail polish, gaffer-taping the wing mirror (in matching red of course), and fixing the cracked headlight with modelling plastic (I'm <em>basically</em> a mechanic at this point).
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Materials.png" alt="general fixer-upper materials">
<p>
	Next was the Corolla, I would spray paint the inner wheels black so that when I put my hubcaps on, they'd almost look like real mags—I'd also get an extra set, so I had four replacements for the front left wheel, which I routinely curbed. But my eyes did begin to wander… and that's when I saw it—the dream car. Now, it might better be termed "the nightmare car" due to the its creator's antics: a shiny, white, Tesla Model 3 (before you judge, this was well before he went "Full Elon").
</p>
<p>
	I loved it. 25 years on from those teenage nights in downtown New Plymouth… I had <strong><em>made it</em></strong> . Finally I had a cool car, and all the unworthy adolescent angst and baggage I had carried throughout my life was swept away, I was complete.
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Tesla.png" alt="a rabbit driving a Tesla">
<p>
	And I was so careful—Can you have a drive? No. Can you eat your chicken nuggets in the back, No! Can you turn on the seat heating?… Why yes, I thought you'd never ask…
</p>
<p>
	But old habits die hard. Sneaking into a tight park—<b>CRUNCH</b>—I stooped to inspect my first, ghastly instance of curb rash!
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Panic02.png" alt="a rabbit panicking">
<p>
	For months it haunted me, a constant reminder of my folly. I would replay it over and over in my mind—if only I'd turned earlier, what if I'd left a minute later?</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Panic03.png" alt="a rabbit panicking">
    
    <p>Sometimes, because it was on the passenger side, I wouldn't see it for days and I'd forget, but then the memory would come flooding back—shining bright silver through the grey veneer.
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Panic04.png" alt="a rabbit panicking">
<p>
	And then it dawned on me. The skills I had developed over a lifetime of making minor cosmetic touch-ups, had prepared me for this very moment. I would find my old black spray can, and mix it with lead-belcher grey modelling paint to make the perfect tone, to heal the scar and hide my shame.
</p>
<p>
	I responsibly marked up the area, and found a small piece of cardboard to mix the paint on, but when I pressed the nozzle, there was no pressure in the old can, and yet it was still heavy. So, determined to access the paint, I did what <bs>any sensible person would</bs>, I took a sharp knife... and punctured the can.
</p>
<p>
	And that is where it all went <b><i>horribly wrong</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
	Black paint sprayed straight in my eyes, the can hit the ground spinning like a Tasmanian devil, radiating a hellish black cloud. I pounced—struggling to grasp the wild beast, eventually, wrestling it into submission.
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_SpotsFlipped.png" alt="Random spots">
<p>
	In the silence that followed I stood and looked down at my ruined sneakers, sneakers that had once been bright white… just like my car, <i>right <b>behind me!</b></i>
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Panic01.png" alt="a rabbit panicking with spray paint on his face">
	<h3>AAAAGH!</h3>
<p>
	A gust of wind had carried the dark swarm into, and all the way over the car. Not an inch was spared from the tiny black spots of fast-drying, hard-wearing enamel.
</p>
	<img src="./Images/Content/NoMatter_Spots.png" alt="Random spots">

<p>
	My wife, who'd heard the commotion, and the only one in command of her faculties, handed me a rag and a bottle of Isopropyl alcohol, and I began frantically scrubbing at the bodywork, making a good start, but progress slowed as the paint began to dry and cure. For two excruciating hours I scrubbed, all the while thinking…
</p>
<blockquote>
	No matter where you get to, there you are.
</blockquote>
<p>
	I did eventually get the car clean, and later did get around to fixing the curb rash, but every now and again, I notice, a lone black speck, on the windshield, or under the boot handle, and I am reminded that you never truly <i>make it</i>...</p><p>... you're always <b>a work in progress</b>.
