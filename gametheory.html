    <p><a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html">Non-Zero-Sum games</a> are just one aspect of the wider field of Game Theory; a fascinating field of mathematics that deals with models of conflict and cooperation among rational decision-makers.</p>

    <p>While humans have used game-theoretical ideas throughout history, Game Theory was formalised by John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in their seminal work, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior", in 1944.</p>

    <h3>KEY CONCEPTS IN GAME THEORY</h3>
    <p>Here are some pivotal ideas in the study of game theory:</p>
    <footer>
        <h3 id="BasicConcepts">BASIC CONCEPTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="Player"><strong>Player:</strong> Anyone with skin in the game, like a team member in a football game, a CEO in corporate politics, or even countries in global diplomacy. In Game Theory, players are expected to act rationally, strictly within the parameters of the game, this can lead to behaviours that don't reflect social norms.</li>

            <img src="./Images/Content/Liv_HawkAndDove.png" alt="Game chips">
            <li><strong>Agent:</strong> Can be used interchangeably with player, but often refers to a non-human player in a multi-<i>agent</i> simulation. Agents are often used to trial a given behaviour, and so are not necessarily rational, rather they used to find the most effective <span class="expandable-word" data-info="Axelrod's simulations showed a cooperative tit-for-tat strategy was the most effective for a multi-agent iterated prisoner's dilemma.">response</span> to a complex situation.</li>
            <li id="Strategy"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Your plan of action, whether you're lining up behind a spawn point or planning a long-term business model.</li>
            <li id="Payoff"><strong>Payoff:</strong> What you get out of it, from winning a bet to securing a long-term business contract. This is defined in a...</li>
            <li><strong>Payoff Matrix:</strong> A table that shows the payoffs for each player for each possible combination of strategies, like the one below:</li>

        <h3 id="TypesOfGames">TYPES OF GAMES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="ZeroSumGame"><strong><a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#ZeroSumGames">Zero-Sum Game</a>:</strong> Where one's loss is another's gain, from tug-of-war to legal battles. Zero-sum is also often used to refer to <i><b>constant</b></i>-sum situations, like if I say "winner gets five bucks", the <i>sum</i> is technically $5, but there is no outcome where completing the game leads to the share of winnings being lesser or greater than $5.</li>
            <li id="NonZeroSumGame"><strong><a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html">Non-Zero-Sum Game</a>:</strong> Usually used to describe in-win situations, like mutually beneficial trade agreements or collaborative research projects. But, it can also refer to any game that is not constant-sum, including lose-lose situations.</li>

            <li id="SimultaneousGame"><strong>Simultaneous Game:</strong> Players act at the same time, from Rock-Paper-Scissors to blind auctions.</li>

        <h3 id="GamesOfStrategy">CLASSIC GAMES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="PrisonersDilemma"><strong><a href="prisonersdilemma.html">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>:</strong> A classic example of a non-zero-sum game, where the best outcome for both players is to cooperate, but the "rational" choice is to defect.</li>

            <img src="./Images/Content/Subgame_PrisonersDilemma.png" alt="Prisoner's Dilemma">

            <li id="StagHunt"><strong><a href="staghunt.html">Stag Hunt</a>:</strong> Choose between a risky option that benefits everyone or a safe option that benefits only you.</li>

            <li id="UltimatumGame"><strong><a href="ultimatumgame.html">Ultimatum Game</a>:</strong> A game where one player offers a split of a reward, and the other player decides whether to accept or reject the offer. If the offer is rejected, neither player gets anything.</li>


            <img src="./Images/Content/Relative_CatsCash.png" alt="A cat handing cash to another cat">

            <li id="BattleOfTheSexes"><strong><a href="battleofthesexes.html">Battle of The Sexes</a>:</strong> Players have different preferences, like deciding between a romantic comedy and an action movie, but they would prefer to do something together.</li>

            <!-- hawk and dove  -->
            <li id="HawkAndDove"><strong>Hawk and Dove:</strong> Players choose between aggressive and passive strategies, like elk stags fighting for dominance and clashing when they're evenly matched, or street vendors competing for optimal position.</li>

            <img src="./Images/Content/Liv_SeekAndDestroy.png" alt="A hawk attacking">

            <li id="Public Goods Game"><strong><a href="socialdilemmas.html">Public Goods Game</a>:</strong> Choose to contribute to a public good or keep your resources to yourself!</li>

            <li id="Chicken"><strong><a href="chicken.html">Chicken</a>:</strong> The first to swerve loses, but if neither swerves, both lose.</li>

        <h3 id="StrategiesAndEquilibria">STRATEGIES AND EQUILIBRIA</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="NashEquilibrium"><strong><a href="nashequilibrium.html">Nash Equilibrium</a>:</strong> No one can benefit from changing their strategy if others don't, like stopping at traffic lights, or driving on the correct side of the road.</li>

            <img src="./Images/Content/TrafficLights_RedAnnoyed.png" alt="Traffic Lights">

            <li id="DominantStrategy"><strong>Dominant Strategy:</strong> A strategy that guarantees a win or draw: Like defecting in the a single round of <a href="prisonersdilemma.html">the Prisoner's Dilemma</a>. A rare example of tic-tac-toe has a dominant strategy right from the start for both players that always leads to a draw - making it a very limited game. Often dominant strategies will become available at a point of leverage in a game, like two rooks against a king reveals the strategy of driving the king to the end of the board.</li>
            <li id="DominatedStrategy"><strong>Dominated Strategy:</strong> The always worse option, like folding in poker no matter your hand, always choosing the defensive play in football or camping in a deathmatch.</li>
            <li id="MixedStrategy"><strong>Mixed Strategy:</strong> Introducing randomness, from mixing up your serves in tennis to changing up your pricing strategy in a bidding war.</li>

            <li id="RepeatedGames"><strong><a href="repeatedgames.html">Iterated or Repeated Games</a>:</strong> Where strategies can change because of the potential for future interactions. These can often lead to a more cooperative strategy and are more reflective of real world interactions where actions have consequences, and events are never entirely isolated.</li>

            <li id="DiscountFactor"><strong><a href="discountfactor.html">Discount Factor</a>:</strong> A value that represents the importance of future payoffs, like the saying "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush".</li>

            <li id="ExtensiveForm"><strong>Extensive Form:</strong> Using tree-like diagrams to map sequential moves, useful in chess and corporate decision-making.</li>

            <a href="#TreeDiagram"><img src="./Images/Content/Subgame_UltimatumTree.png" alt="A game tree representing the Ultimatum Game"></a>
