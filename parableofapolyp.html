    <p>One <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html#ZeroSumGames">zero-sum</a> situation that becomes <a href="whatarenonzerosumgames.html"><i><b>non</b></i>-zero-sum</a>, in a profound way, is the story of coral<sub>•••</sub></p>
    <p>A coral polyp is an animal (yep<sub>•••</sub>) which is born into a life of fierce competition<sub>•</sub> The polyp, which resembles something right out of 'Stranger Things', uses stinging tentacles to battle other polyps for dominance over territory, like a very mean and nasty game of 'Go'<sub>•</sub></p>

    <p><img src="./Images/Content/GoPuns.png"></p>
        
    <p>Once the polyp has established a base it goes about cloning itself to fill its niche<sub>•</sub> But this is where the Gigeresque nightmare ends and the Disney-Pixar fairytale begins<sub>•</sub> In fact, once the polyp colony has been established, it begins building a range of friendly relationships, firstly between the clones themselves which build a unified protective body and share nutrients through a sort of "gastric" system (tap below for an "<i>artist</i>'s impression").</p>

    <p><img id="imageToSwap" src="./Images/Content/PolypColony.png" alt="Cards being swapped" onclick="swapImage(this, './Images/Content/PolypColony.png', './Images/Content/PolypColonyConnected.png')" style="cursor:pointer;"></p>

    <p>Then they get chummy with the ocean fauna, most famously in the example of relationship between a polyp - the sea anemone and the clown fish (Pixar call-back)<sub>•</sub> And in the end, after initially competing with other polyps, the coral becomes a shelter for its jellyfish brethren (yes, they are also polyps!) who in return provide nitrogen essential for coral health<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>In fact the polyp itself is a non-zero system that benefits from a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae known as zooxanthellae which are what give coral its beautiful <span style="color:#e74aff">c</span><span style="color:#66CC66">o</span><span style="color:#FF9966">l</span><span style="color:#FFCCCC">o</span><span style="color:#FF0066">u</span><span style="color:#8254ff">r</span>. These algae contribute to both the coral and the rest us by producing oxygen through photosynthesis<sub>•</sub> In fact it's estimated that marine photosynthetic organisms produce 50-80% of the world's oxygen<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>Tragically, many coral reefs are becoming gray and dying due to pollution, acidification and temperature change<sub>•</sub> When the reefs lose their vibrant hues, it signifies that these symbiotic organisms are no longer producing oxygen<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>What a downer<sub>•••</sub></p>

    <h3>SO<sub>•••</sub></h3>
    <p>Our unlikely heroes of the deep are a testament to the transformative power of adopting a non-zero-sum mindset<sub>•</sub> The polyps' journey from ruthless competitors to intricate contributors in a thriving ecosystem underlines the potential that lies in cooperation and symbiosis<sub>•</sub></p>
    <p>We are incredibly lucky to benefit from such a confluence of naturally occurring non-zero-sum games and in essence, the philosophy of this site is a call to action to build upon this<sub>•</sub> Let's challenge ourselves to find the "coral polyps" in our own lives - those opportunities to transform zero-sum scenarios into non-zero-sum games<sub>•</sub> We might discover that we're not only enhancing our own lives but also contributing to a better world<sub>•</sub></p><p>Phew, that's better note to end on!</p>
