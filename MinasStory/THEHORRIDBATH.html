THE HORRID BATH</h1><p>

It was made from the crystals that were finest, but it wasn't <u>that</u> that was troubling me, it was what was inside it.<br><br>I knew, by the look of it, it was made by the eyeballs of cochroaches, it was like olive mash.<br><br>Someone who liked olives would say I was lucky, but it was the colour and... imagine bathing in it!<br><br>I step in...<br><br>Suddenly the water changed to rainbow water.<br><br>The next day I see the bath, I imagine the olive colour, then the rainbow. I jump in...<br><br>Oops there's no water, I hit the hard crystal floor, I've sprained my ankle.</p>
