            <p>NEUTROPIA has been that project I've been working on since I began teaching myself to code, it's been through many iterations, and has spawned many variations and experiments. It is, to me the essential Non Zero Sum Game, in that you have a positive and negative balance, but through chain reactions, one can get the upper hand</p>
            <p>This is an early demo from 2015</p>

            <p>Shortly after showcasing this, Victoria Smith wrote an <a href="victoriasmitharticle.html">article</a> about it, and that inspired me to make it more rich and complex (which may have been a mistake!!! Because 7 years later I'm still tinkering). If you're on Twitter and would like to follow my (very slow) progress follow <a href="https://twitter.com/NEUTROPIA">@NEUTROPIA</a></p>
            <p>The following are some of the original sketches and designs as the project developed, as you can see it has been characterised by indecision</p>
