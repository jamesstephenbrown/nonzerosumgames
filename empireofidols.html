        <h1>Empire of Idols</h1>
        <p>A series of paintings exhibited at Orex Art Gallery, the US Ambassador's Residence, the Pah Homestead, and many spent years in my shed, until brave people took them off my hands</p>

            <p>"The Birth of Tragedy" was a Finalist in the <a href="https://www.wallaceartstrust.org.nz/wallace-art-awards" target="blank">Wallace Art Awards</a> and is now hanging in my stairwell scaring everyone who visits</p><br><br>

            <img src="./Images/Paintings/EmpireOfIdols/Fish and Human.png" class="portraits">
            <p>"I believe that the Fish and Human can co-exist peacefully" was a finalist in the Empire Arts Young Artists competition, and everyone wants it, but can't have it because it's my favorite</p><br><br>
            <img src="./Images/Paintings/EmpireOfIdols/Mindfields.jpg" class="portraits">
            <p>"Mindfields" was purchased by NZ art collector James Wallace and is housed at the <a href="https://collection.wallaceartstrust.org.nz/objects/5746/mindfields" target="blank">Pah Homestead</a> so it's like, a legit artwork</p><br><br>
            <img src="./Images/Paintings/EmpireOfIdols/Frontier.jpg" class="portraits">
            <p>"Frontier" is in the 'private collection' of dedicated James Brown art collectors Wendy and Stephen Brown (Mum & Dad)</p><br><br>
