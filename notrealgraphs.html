    <p><img src="./Images/Content/Hog_TimeScale.png" alt="Hog Time Scale"></p>

    <p>These are a random assortment of (not real) graphs—visual stories that help me understand the world, which are collected from all the posts. They are not always based on real data, but rather on my insights and experiences, like the one above that shows the <span class="expandable-word" data-info="A word I made up to describe humanity's point of view (scope) as beginning in the middle (meso) as opposed to microscopic or macroscopic views">mesoscopic</span> position of humans in relation to time and the scale of the Universe, from <a href="itssubjective.html">it's subjective</a>. </p><p>I hope you find them interesting and thought-provoking.</p>

        <h3>MY UNDERSTANDING OF LOCAL MINIMA & MAXIMA</h3>
        <img src="./Images/Content/NotRealGraphs_LocalMaximaMinima.png" alt="Local Minima and Maxima Graph">
    <p>This is a sketch in lieu of a post—the concept of local minima and maxima is a mental model I often use to understand inefficiencies in the world. The basic idea is that many solutions to a problem aren't actually <span class="expandable-word" data-info="Optimised for a balance of various priorities">satisficing</span>, but people fail to deviate from those solutions because, in order to travel to a satisficing solution, they have to traverse negative terrain.</p>
    
    <p>A good example would be the transfer from fossil fuels to renewables. Before getting to the more satisficing solution, you have to bear the costs associated with R&D, social inertia, early inefficiencies, regulations etc. And so the development of renewables has been slower than necessary due to a reluctance to traverse that terrain.</p>

        <h3>MY UNDERSTANDING OF DOPAMINURGIC VS ADRENAL RESPONSE</h3>
        <img src="./Images/Content/NotRealGraphs_DopamineVsAdrenaline.png" alt="Dopamine vs Adrenal Response Graph">
    <p>This was one that I sketched out based on what I'd learned about the different physiological responses one has to adrenaline and dopamine. I had previously thought that the responses were essentially synonymous. But apparently, while dopamine spikes make you less sensitive to dopamine, adrenaline spikes actually make you more responsive to adrenaline. Meaning that if you continually spike your adrenaline in order to enjoy the dopamine high that comes with it, you simultaneously make yourself more stressed and less motivated.</p><p>This has helped me make sense of my increased anxiety when I indulge the vices of driving fast, playing speed chess or arguing online.</p>
