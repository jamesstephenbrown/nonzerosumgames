<h1>NON-ZERO-SUM THINKING</h1>
<img src="./Images/Content/Lifes_A_Game.png" alt="Life's A Game">
<p>Hey everyone, today we're going to be playing some games so there are going to be some <i>rules!</i></p>


<blockquote>
<h3>RULES</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're going to be breaking into pairs.</li>
<li>Each student is trying to get as many counters as they can - there will be a winner.</li>
<li>But we will also be looking at how many you get as a pair and altogether.</li>
<li>We are using these games to reflect on the real world, if they spark any ideas for you let the group know.</li>
<li>These are just games, they will include opportunities to make choices that might be considered questionable, after the games are complete we are still going to be friends.</li>
<li>I encourage everyone to use a wide range of strategies and give something a go if you think it will work. This will help demonstrate different ideas.</li>
<li>While it is within the rules to lie about your intentions in a game, it is not okay to actually cheat or steal actual tokens from someone else or the pool.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>A STORY OF A ROBBERY...</h3>
<p>Should you betray your partner to save yourself?</p>
<img src="./Images/Content/WhyCooperate_Buttons.png" alt="Why Cooperate Buttons">

<blockquote>
    <h2>GAME 1 : THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is one round of play.</li>
<li>You choose to cooperate or defect (betray) your partner.</li>
<li>You can keep secret or lie about what you're going to do.</li>
<li>You show your decision by taking one counter behind your back then putting a closed fist forward to your partner - and they do the same.</li>
<li>If you reveal a counter you have chosen to cooperate if not you are defecting.</li>
<li>If you both reveal a counter you receive 3 counters each.</li>
<li>If you both betray you receive 1 counter counter each.</li>
<li>If one of you cooperates and the other defects, the defector gets 5 and the cooperator gets 0.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What is game theory?<br>What are non-zero-sum games?</p>
<img src="./Images/Content/HH_Rabbit.png" alt="HH Rabbit">
<p>What are zero-sum games?</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>GAME 2 : ZERO-SUM GAMES DEMO</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 volunteers each brings up 5 counters</li>
<li>One gives their counters to the other (zero-sum game win-lose)</li>
<li>The other gives them back (another zero-sum game draw-draw)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<img src="./Images/Content/HH_SharingBack.png" alt="HH Sharing Back">

<p>Can you think of some examples of zero-sum games?</p>

<p>Non-zero-sum games = Ethics / Economics / Interconnected Systems</p>

<h2>ETHICS</h2>
<p>We've already started looking at ethics in the Prisoner's dilemma, where you have an ethical decision between being loyal to your partner or thinking about your individual well being.</p>
<p>Did you think it was a zero-sum game? or a non-zero-sum game?</p>
<p>What strategy is best?</p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>GAME 3 : ITERATIVE PRISONER'S DILEMMA</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 rounds of the prisoner's dilemma</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Who did the best cooperators or defectors?</p>
<img src="./Images/Content/Alignment_VennDiagram.png" alt="Alignment Venn Diagram">

<h2>ECONOMICS / TRADE</h2>
<p>Another key example of non-zero-sum games is trade - where you have one country that has, for instance like NZ, lot's of high quality beef or milk, but not so much in the way of pineapples of computers. We are able to export goods that we can produce a lot of, and use the profit to buy goods that we can't produce.</p>

<img id="imageToSwap" src="./Images/Content/Cards.png" alt="Cards held by a crab being swapped when you click on the image" onclick="swapImage(this, './Images/Content/Cards.png', './Images/Content/Cards_Swapped.png')" style="cursor:pointer;">
       
<blockquote>
<h3>GAME 4 : CARD SWAP GAME</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each player gets 4 cards</li>
<li>You have 5 minutes to swap with others to try and get the longest sequence you can</li>
<li>You get points for the length of your sequence</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn't it remarkable that sometimes just by trading what we don't need we can get everything we need?</p>

<p>So, we're starting to see that we have to take each other into account when making decisions, even if we are only out for our own gains. How far does thinking about others and the world outside us need to go though?</p>

<h2>INTERCONNECTEDNESS</h2>
<img src="./Images/Content/WhyCooperate_CoopWorld.png" alt="Why Cooperate Cooperative World">
<blockquote>
<h3>GAME 5 : TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>This game goes for 5 rounds or until everyone pulls out</li>
<li>Each player places 2 counters on the table</li>
<li>For ever 2 counters one counter is added</li>
<li>Now all players use a dice to line up</li>
<li>Each player as they go down the line can take as many counters as they want</li>
<li>You can opt in or out</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
    What would happen if the same person got to go first every time?<br>
    Or the richest person got to go first every time?<br>
    What if people could take what the wanted in secret?<br>
What would happen if profits were shared equally / unequally (is the sum the same?)<br>
What would happen if you could choose how much you put in?<br>
What if we take into account the environment?<br>
</p>
<img src="./Images/Content/Recycling_ToxinDiagram.png" alt="Recycling Toxin Diagram">

<blockquote>
<h3>GAME 6 : THE OPEN ACCESS PROBLEM</h3>
<ul>
<li>This game goes for 5 rounds or until everyone pulls out</li>
<li>The game begins with 20 counters on the table (the environment "e")</li>
<li>Each player places 1 counter on the table</li>
<li>The total counters is multiplied by e/10 (so if there are 20 e counters the amount of player counters is multiplied by 2)</li>
<li>Now all players use a dice to line up</li>
<li>Each player as they go down the line can take as many counters as they want</li>
<li>You can opt in or out</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What did you learn from this game?<br>
    How does this experiment map to the real world?</p>
<blockquote>
    <h3>BONUS GAME : ULTIMATUM GAME</h3>
    <p>only if we have time...</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>AND THE WINNER IS...</h3>
<p>We will look at who got that most tokens, but also what pairs got the most, and how many you got altogether. What did we learn about what strategies to use, what worked in the short term and in the long term?</p>
<p>The winner's prize will be determined by the other players, after all we live in a world made of other people.</p>

<h2>SO...</h2>
<p>Non-zero-sum games are a lens through which we can look at the world.</p>
<img src="./Images/Content/Alignment_Scale.png" alt="Alignment Scale">

<p>By thinking about the sum value of any situation, we can think more clearly about whether it's something we want to be involved in. What games do we want to play, and which do we want to avoid?</p>
<img src="./Images/Content/Pareto_Accumulative.png" alt="Pareto Accumulative">
<p>How can me make a world where, over time cooperative benefits accumulate, so that everyone wins?</p>
