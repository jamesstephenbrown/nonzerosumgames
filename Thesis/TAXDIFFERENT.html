Increasingly, capital is being hoarded in non-productive assets, such as real estate and the financial industry. Meanwhile the traditional role of capital investment in job creation is being undermined by automation, take for example Amazon's increasingly automated workforce coupled with its displacement of small retail businesses.<br><br>This trend drives inequality and undermines democracy, but it is a solvable problem. The problem with tax is that there are different rules for the big players. Tax Havens are in a race to the bottom (literally to 0% in Bermuda and the Bahamas). And capitalists, including the darlings of silicon valley set up "offices" in these havens, and through offshore accounts and financial trickery are able to avoid tax on billions of dollars in profit. Meanwhile the bulk of tax is paid on income tax within countries, by you and me, and worse still, paid on GST, which targets all the sorts of purchases that everyday people use. What they don't target are large asset sales (the mainstay of capitalist investment) and other capital exchanges, stocks etc. So, the people who are affected are people in the middle and bottom.<br><br>While there are plenty of taxes on low-middle income earners, and loopholes for corporate taxes for the biggest global companies, there are also currently no taxes on capital, so it is understandable that capital is becoming concentrated.<br><br>Taxes that will make a difference to income distribution and will lower the tax burden on middle-low income earners are<br><br>	TAX 1. Capital gains tax - will balance the advantage of investing in static assets<br>	TAX 2. Inheritance tax - stems the flow of wealth to brats who have already benefitted from coming from wealth<br>	TAX 3. Capital tax - erodes large fortunes deterring the hoarding of wealth and encouraging investment in innovation<br>	TAX 4. Customer-Country-based corporate tax - companies are taxed depending on where their customers are.<br><br>A customer-country based tax effectively eradicates tax havens. It is not the same as a consumption tax, in fact consumption taxes such as GST and VAT actually affect the people on the lower end much more than those on the top, and I would advise cutting those altogether. Although the tax is based on where consumption takes place its structure is different. First of all, this is (like with present corporate tax) a tax on profits only where as GST is incurred by the consumer on every purchase.<br><br>This does mean that goods may be different prices in different countries, but there will no longer be an incentive to drop tax rates by governments unless they are doing so to actually attract tourism through supplying cheaper goods. This will be possible and is a fair compromise any country is free to make, but it will no longer be possible for them to provide tax avoidance services on billions of dollars every year.</p>
