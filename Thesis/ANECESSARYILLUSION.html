In many respects we are blind to many of the limitations to our will, and so it is important to recognise that we do not control our desires, or consciously bring thoughts to our own mind, not to mention the genetic and circumstantial experiences that are out of our control. While facets of much of what we experience as a sense of free will can be understood meaningfully, the whole will and the idea of some unified metaphysical conscious self is an illusion. As with the ocular blindspot, the mind fills the gaps between memories, sensory input and subconscious decision-making to give the illusion of self.<br><br>However, the possibility of free will being an illusion makes less difference to one's life that its seeming profundity implies, <a href ="PROFOUNDTRUTHSMAKELITTLEDIFFERENCE.html">as is often the case with paradigm shifts</a>. After all, it begs the question "If we have no free will, then are we not free to live differently than we have, that is; as if we have free will? - the primary (albeit glib) paradox.</p>
