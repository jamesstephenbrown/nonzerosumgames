We have already looked at charity and its relationship to taxation; that they correlate positively, higher taxes correspond to greater charity, establishing that charity will not fill a gap left by lower taxation. And we have examined the idea of charity as a tax on kindness and, given both of these ideas, concluded that taxes are a far preferable answer to wealth redistribution. Having concluded this, there is still a growing inequality that taxation is not addressing, and so in lieu of greater, more effective and fair taxes, charity is necessary at present to help plug the gap.</p>
