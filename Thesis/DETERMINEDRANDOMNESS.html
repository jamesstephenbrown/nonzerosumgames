A caveat to determinism might be found not in randomness, but the determined application of randomness; "freeing your mind" as Morpheus would put it. Introducing a process outside of what is usual like having a shower (making a decision to change the state of your brain by physical means) or travelling abroad (exposing your brain to novel experiences) might change your brain's state and reveal new pathways. This process of determined selection, to me at any rate, seems to be at the heart of free will, illusion or not.</p>
