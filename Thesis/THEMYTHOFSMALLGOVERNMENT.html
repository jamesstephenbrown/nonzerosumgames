The prevalence of diversity measures in hiring and representation across private businesses and universities takes the wind out of the sales of many Libertarian and right wing critics who want to claim that these measures are indicative of a big government "nanny state". Ironically it is precisely the invisible hand of the market through the demand of consumers that drives such efforts.<br><br>We find that big government is a slur that refers only to governments that provide services and protection for those worst off in society. When it comes to protecting freedom of speech for baby-boomers or defence spending, or border walls, suddenly the size of the government is no longer an issue. When the likes of Jordan Peterson or Dave Rubin claim that their freedom of speech is being curtailed, to whom are they appealing? Who after all protects their rights? If their politics are to be consistent, shouldn't the market just sort this out? Shouldn't the respect for their views simply reflect their merit?</p>
