Take for instance the kick off coin toss. Let's assume you want to kick off. You call heads, the referee flips a coin... tails. You purse your lips, disappointed. The referee turns to you and says "Another go?". For some reason you have another chance... and another... until you get the result you want.<br><br>This is what it is like making decisions, you have options you can run through in your head, they arise without your volition, but you can choose from a number of them. If you can't see a promising option you can try something to change your state of mind and try again. Reduced to its component parts, each stage was either determined or random, but the combination of the two resulted in a decision based on your own desires.</p>
