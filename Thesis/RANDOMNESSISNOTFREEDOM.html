Sam Harris argues in "Free Will" that one does not get around determinism by the introduction of randomness. While this introduction of randomness undermines a deterministic and predictable universe, it does not make one's thoughts any more free.<br><br>He is correct in the sense that flipping a coin gives you no more freedom to choose who kicks off in a game of rugby than if the referee ruled it by fiat. However this is like saying "There is no point adding white to black to make grey because you cannot derive grey from white". A combination of two elements can produce emergent phenomena that are not present in either element.</p>
