We have established that conscious experience is the unit of value, it may be an illusion as with many aspects of free will, and there may be other objectively valuable things in the universe, but the only value we know of exists in conscious experience. So, the issue of preserving conscious experience, and perhaps some of our better human values along with it, is the existential goal. But as with the piecemeal progress of our individual and societal systems, we should be looking to sustainable adaptation rather than a plan written in stone. It is not known yet if consciousness can transcend the wetware of animal minds, and this is the topic for another essay, but I would hazard a guess, given all that we've explored in this essay, that slow incremental change is the best way forward. We may or may not be "summoning the demon" as Elon Musk puts it, but we are definitely giving birth to something new with autonomous technologies. Getting our own house order, solving the displacement caused by automation, addressing the current problems of redistribution in our political and economic world and looking inward at what we really value is the only hope for sustaining conscious experience.<br></p>
