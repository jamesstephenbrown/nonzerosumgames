It's hard to ignore that all of the artificial political drives undermining democracy are almost invariably at the hands of those on the right. I don't think it is a coincidence that the policies of the right, don't actually benefit the majority of those that vote right, but benefit a small percentage at the top who can employ tactics of mass persuasion and political influence, where it would be impossible to convince people with a bare examination of the facts. Meanwhile the high-minded politicians of the left rightly denigrate this dirty game, meanwhile their constituents, only recognising the currency of righteousness, are hyper-critical of their own candidates, and they pay the price in the poles.</p>
