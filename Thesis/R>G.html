Much of my understanding of our current economic predicament comes from editing a documentary about french economist Thomas Piketty's book "Capital in the 21st Century". If you take away anything from this book it will be the formula R > G; that the rate of return on investment is greater than the growth rate of the economy. Now, because R > G it is better for a capitalist to put their capital into static assets that historically appreciate at 4.5% as opposed to investing in industries; the working economy, innovation etc which grows at an average of 1.5%. This tends toward inequality. Because money is being held out of the working economy, it is not creating innovation, and new industries that benefit humanity, and it's not creating jobs. It's simply multiplying wealth, for those who already have it.<br></p>
