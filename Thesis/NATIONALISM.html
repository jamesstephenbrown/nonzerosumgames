Yuval Noah Harari has a clever-sounding point about the threat of Nationalism...<br><br>"Contrary to common wisdom, nationalism is not a natural and eternal part of the human psyche... it is hardly natural for humans to be loyal to millions of utter strangers"<br><br>While, on the surface of it, this might give one pause about how they look at human progress, it is an example of a deepity, in that it seems to say more than it does. In terms of what nationalism represents in today's global community, it is a regressive nationalism, rather than the progressive nationalism that Harari references, and so it is very much a manifestation of tribalism. Reframing the issue as Harari does fails to alleviate the threat that regressive nationalism poses. To avoid any confusion however, where I can I will refer directly to localism rather than the loaded terms of nationalism or tribalism.</p>
