These utopias are all extreme versions about attaining pleasure, ambitions and overcoming challenges, not dying or suffering great injury. They all require that wealth is distributed (without this they become dystopias), and that conscious experience is primary. But it also seems that many situations are only really possible in simulation, as they require a double standard, or some level of subjugation over other beings, be it AI or simulated humans. For many, the reality of a situation is important, so simulations don't count.<br></p>
