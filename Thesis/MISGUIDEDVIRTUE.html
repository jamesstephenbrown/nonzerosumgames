Take for instance tithing to a particular church that preaches opposition to equal rights for women, homosexuals or infidels, and spends the tithings on real estate to spread its anti-social message. Or a business owner producing a useless product who buys into the creed that greed is good, and goes about automating her workforce and avoiding tax out of loyalty to shareholders who also avoid tax, resulting in no tax revenue and no employment. Yet because the business owner believes a story about contributing to the economy, they give themselves licence to commit crimes against the environment in the production of their product.</p>
