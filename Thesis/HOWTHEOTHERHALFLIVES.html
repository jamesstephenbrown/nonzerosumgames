Humans' propensity to perceive the world relativistically sustains divisions in the world because of our avoidance of the unfamiliar. One method for people to increase struggle and adventure would be to share experiences with people of different walks of life, which has the added benefit of building a more objective perspective of what is truly significant. The benefits of are three-fold. First of all, it introduces a level of struggle and adventure, humbling you by making you aware of some actual deficiencies you only noticed once you ventured out of your element, which builds character. Secondly it breaks down barriers to extending wealth, rights and dignity to people in a wider circle of moral concern. Finally there is also something to be said for the relativistic sentiment that to appreciate the positive we must experience the negative; one gives shape to the other. Some of the most enduring lessons I've learned have been from negative experiences, my own and witnessing those of others. So, experiencing how the other half lives also helps people to appreciate what they have, rather than constantly striving to keep up with the Joneses.</p>
