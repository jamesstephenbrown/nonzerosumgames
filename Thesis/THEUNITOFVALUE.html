We must appreciate that subjective experience is the unit of value in this equation. Without <a href ="SUBJECTIVITY.html">subjective</a> experience there is no qualitative value, thus no point to ethics. Furthermore, while there is a range of experience amongst different human beings and animals, we must acknowledge that we share some degree of commonality in our experience as human animals. Without such a commonality of experience, no value system could be developed that was practicable.</p>
