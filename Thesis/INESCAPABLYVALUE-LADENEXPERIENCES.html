Our evolutionary hardwiring is not easily decoded, it is embedded in myriad mechanisms and behaviour modifiers. At the core of these are sensation and its poles pleasure and pain. Pain tells us to avoid the behaviour, pleasure to seek it - these experiences are inescapably value-laden. They are nature's way of creating a should from a fact of biology. I would posit that all our values are derived from the spectrum of these inescapably value-laden experiences.</p>
