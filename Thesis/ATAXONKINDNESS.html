The expectation that charity is responsible for supporting the unfortunate is akin to a tax on kindness. It actually penalises people who are generous, and rewards greed. It is understandable that philanthropists like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett state they "don't need tax cuts", because it is they who are footing the bill (via charity), while other billionaires like the late Steve Jobs and the richest man in the world Jeff Bezos give next to nothing, while avoiding as much tax as possible. So, while charity is a force for good in the world, it is not the answer to effective and fair wealth redistribution. The only proven way is boring old taxes.<br></p>
