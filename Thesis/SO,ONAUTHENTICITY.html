There are two aspects of authenticity that are important to understand. First of all, anxiety is a natural part of the internal realisation of self but anxiety is irrational (meaning you don't need to let it worry you) and being prepared to face this discomfort may result in personal benefits. Secondly, being open about your personal struggles and anxiety might help others escape pathological loops, it may hold the secret not only for catharsis for yourself and others, but might be also be an effective way of spreading positive ideas more effectively, even virally, making paradigm shifts based on empathy and connection.</p>
