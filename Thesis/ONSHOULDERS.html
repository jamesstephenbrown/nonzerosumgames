One of the most memorable stories for me of substrate emergence is of course that of cyanobacteria, you'll remember it of course, it's very memorable. No? Well, what happened was for 2 billion years bacteria were the only form of life, and they were getting by with an atmosphere Bill Bryson describes in which...<br><br>"there was no more oxygen to breathe on Earth... than there is on Mars today. It was also full of noxious vapours from hydrochloric and sulphuric acids powerful enough to eat through clothing and blister skin."<br><br>Bryson relays...<br><br>"At some point in the first billion years of life, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, learned to tap into a freely available resource â€” the hydrogen that exists in spectacular abundance in water. They absorbed water molecules, supped on the hydrogen, and released the oxygen as waste, and in so doing invented photosynthesis."<br><br>Cyanobacteria were able to thrive by exploiting a substrate of water and in turn, over the succeeding billions of years raised the level of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere to 20% creating the substrate that would be necessary for mitochondria which would thrive and become the substrate for... us.</p>
