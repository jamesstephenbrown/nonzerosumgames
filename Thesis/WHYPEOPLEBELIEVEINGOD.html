Through many conversations with many people I have concluded that there are three ways in which people come to believe in God<br><br>1. They have an experience of what they perceive as God<br><br>2. They are forgiven for or shown kindness despite a flaw in themselves they could not otherwise have overcome<br><br>3. They are born into it and have shaped their life around it.</p>
