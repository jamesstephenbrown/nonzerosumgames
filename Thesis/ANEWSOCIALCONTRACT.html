Beginning with the Realtopia ambitions...<br><br>	Greater fairness and fulfilment of human potential<br>		- because we're in this together<br>	The extension of healthy lives<br>		- because evolution has determined we die, and we don't like it much<br>	Collectively gaining greater control over unhelpful inescapably value-laden experiences<br>		- because we have them, and they're not always in our best interests<br>	A wider empathy and harmony between moral agents<br>		- because the unit of value is conscious experience<br>	A focus on preventative healthcare, including mental health care to proactively address criminal justice<br>		- because free will isn't all it's cracked up to be<br><br>we should add...<br><br>Building strong children<br>		- to create a meritocracy by a more proactive, preventative expansion of affirmative action, addressing disadvantage, rather than outcomes.<br>Freedom of Speech<br>		- because we must trust that the best ideas will win in a fair competition<br>Measured Moral Outrage<br>		- because sometimes arguments aren't just academic, conscious experience is primary<br>Overcoming the dichotomy of bad vs good<br>		- because we are not dealing with a 50-50 split of bad and good intentions, only fearful vs liberal<br>Adopting a communication style that is reassuring<br>		- because fear-based communication drives fearful people to conservative and isolationist positions<br>Representative democracy<br>		- because it's fair and invests everyone in the social contract<br>Behaviour modification through taxation<br>		- to place an economic value on social benefits<br>Socio-Capitalism<br>		- because we can retain the benefits of capitalism without it dictating social values, by attributing economic value to social goods<br>A millennial perspective about purpose in work<br>		- because we have left the period where your labour determines your worth - worth should be derived from your social contribution<br>Women's education<br>		- because equality is an end in itself, and makes overpopulation a horse-shit problem<br>Some form of UBI<br>		- because automation will drive the means of production away from labour towards capital, concentrating wealth requiring redistribution<br><br>and those taxes...<br><br>	TAX 1. Capital gains tax - will balance the advantage of investing in static assets<br>	TAX 2. Inheritance tax - stems the flow of wealth to brats who have already benefitted from coming from wealth<br>	TAX 3. Capital tax - erodes large fortunes deterring the hoarding of wealth and encouraging investment in innovation<br>	TAX 4. Customer-Country-based corporate tax - companies are taxed depending on where their customers are.<br>	TAX 5. Pollution / Carbon taxes<br>	TAX 6. Health tax<br>	TAX 7. Global welfare tax<br><br>and finally...<br><br>World Government to enforce fair taxation<br>		- global initiatives like UBI and new taxes will require global enforcement to eliminate tax avoidance.</p>
