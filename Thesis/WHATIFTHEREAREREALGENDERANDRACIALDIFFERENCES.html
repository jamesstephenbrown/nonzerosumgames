The other objection to Murray comes even if you grant that his research is correct, but that the logic doesn't actually follow.<br><br>Herrnstein and Murray, argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. This elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society. And yet Charles Murray and Jordan Peterson both have a long history of opposing affirmative action. They take the approach that society should provide less support to those less well off. Why? One would think that people who are cognitively disadvantaged should receive greater support from society, to mitigate that disadvantage. But Murray and his followers seem have the opposite intuition. In fact Stephan Molyneux directly claims that intellectual inferiority is the reason that African immigrants seek asylum in European nations with social welfare. So, the concerns about the dark side of this inquiry are not unfounded.</p>
