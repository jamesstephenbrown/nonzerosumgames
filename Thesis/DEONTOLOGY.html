There is a moral system we are all aware of and that is the law, this is based on deontology; duty ethics. This is of course an important part of the social order, but because it is rule-based it has more to do with describing ethics than with originating them. The hospital example would never be possible because of the laws we have, but it does not give an account of how we come to decide on those laws in the first place. So, while it is a practical reality in the world, it has little to offer to a first principles analysis of ethics.</p>
