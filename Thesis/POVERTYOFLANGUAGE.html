The reason this is so important is because we must communicate complex ideas via a low bandwidth medium; language, this is a form of compression on our ideas. It is no surprise that we consume stories for pleasure on Netflix, or in a book, it's no surprise that religions survive past their capacity to answer scientific questions. Stories are part of who we are, this restriction of bandwidth is part of what shapes our humanity, our identities. We have looked at human populations, voter behaviour and systems, but to use nuanced stories effectively we are going to have to appreciate the individuals who will consume them and to do that we have to explore what resonates with us all as individuals.<br></p>
