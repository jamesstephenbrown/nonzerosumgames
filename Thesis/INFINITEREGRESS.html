Sam Harris, in his essay "Free Will" often punctuates his points around free will by bringing them back to our desires - and claiming that we don't choose these desires. In a pure sense he is correct. "Will" derives its meaning from "wish" or "desire" so, to speak of "Free Will" could be interpreted to mean your freedom to choose your desires. But when interrogated this interpretation is absurd. What would it mean to choose to want something you don't already want?</p>
