Structures such as laws and currency are morally privileged power structures whereby trust can be garnered, amplifying benefits. But we are faced with many problematic aspects of moral privilege that grow as our social spheres expand and compound.<br><br>	We can eat meat we didn't kill<br>	We can fight anonymously online<br>	We can send drones to fight wars<br>	We can vote without judgment<br>	We can give or not give to charity without transparency<br>	We can benefit from our ancestor's spoils<br>	We can live happily while others make our clothes in sweatshops<br><br>Today, due to a lack of moral transparency, the biggest moral questions are those related to moral privilege; how we can best exercise our own and how we can augment power structures to benefit everyone.</p>
