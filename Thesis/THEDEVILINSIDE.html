In the recent Wonder Woman film, the evil Ares influences the weak souls of Europe, playing them off against one another and orchestrating World War II. It plays out the notion of people doing "The Devil's work". This notion can be seen as an early biblical insight, that very rarely is one person openly responsible for any great evil and that rather it is the interplay of many agents, none of whom are omniscient, who are simply seeking to increase their own power in a the short term. We've all seen the knowing smirk of a friend who knows they are transgressing some moral principle. <br></p>
