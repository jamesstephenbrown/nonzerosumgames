Stories are, as far as we know, the best way to transmit information in a way that engages people's attention and opens their minds to attach new concepts to old neural structures. Science and reason has always relied on evidence and logic - and it is often successful in cases where it is immediately demonstrable. However, humans are not purely rational beings and science and reason is in a competitive meme-space with competing stories that have no need for evidence or logic. When it comes to shaping a world that flourishes, it is important to communicate the truths of science and reason with the "truths" of narrative fictions.<br></p>
