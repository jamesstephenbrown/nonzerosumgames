"Reversion to the mean" is an explanatory theory for why people infer that punishment is more effective than praise. If someone performs worse than usual and is punished, when they simply return to normal they appear to have improved as a result of punishment - and visa versa - when someone performs better than usual they appear to get worse when they return to their average after praise. Praise and punishment have nothing to do with it, people naturally oscillate in their behaviour around a mean, giving the illusion of punishment being effective, and praise ineffective.</p>
