Today we in the west live in a society who can easily close our eyes to the means of production behind our consumption. And those marketing the goods have a vested interest in this opaque process - they don't want us to see how the sausage is made, even more than we don't, and they certainly don't want to allow us to make eye contact with the dollar a day indentured sweat-shop worker. We balk at the idea of keeping slaves as an anathema to modern civil rights, but how often do people buy T-shirts for $8.99 and not question how did this get here so cheaply?</p>
