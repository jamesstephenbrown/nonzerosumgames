A zero-sum game is one in which the benefit to one party in an interaction with another is inversely proportionate to the benefit of the other. So, if one party wins the other must lose by an equal amount, leaving a sum total of zero benefit overall. A non-zero-sum game is one where an interaction can be mutually beneficial, and so value can actually grow.</p>
