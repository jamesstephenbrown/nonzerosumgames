An important measure of well-being is happiness. But why should that happiness be equally distributed? In addition to adhering to a consistent standard, studies about happiness show that under a certain degree of wealth, happiness dramatically drops, and above a certain degree of wealth, the happiness returns drop off dramatically. So, by a simple Utilitarian calculus, it would stand to reason that there is an optimal range of wealth distribution that tends towards keeping people within a wealth range that yields the greatest total happiness.</p>
