Another acknowledgment that it is important to make at the outset of political exploration, is that any system of politics that requires people to be better behaved or more altruistic than they currently are is naive and doomed to failure. The attitude that "people just need to be better" is completely unproductive, an honest acknowledgment of human flaws is vital to a robust system, and one that can make a positive out of a vice is stronger for it. Capitalism and its reverence for competition is strong in this respect self-balancing in many respects while requiring nothing but selfishness from its adherents - but at times it fails to acknowledge human flaws, namely that competition is good if everyone is honest, but humans are not all honest and loopholes will be capitalised on.</p>
