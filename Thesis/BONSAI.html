The bonsai tree, for me symbolises the emphasis on intentional living in Japan. It celebrates contemplation, aesthetics and nurturing. A lesson for how we can live more intentional lives.<br>Imagine your life as a tree, your branches take paths based on decisions you make. In every season what is seen by the outside world is the plumage of our tree. Plumage brings pleasure to an audience and yet obscures the branching paths we have taken. When we dream of our future, we see it as others do, with the branches hidden. The following section is not a self-help guide, but a guide to developing individual behaviours that benefit conscious experience, ours and others'.</p>
