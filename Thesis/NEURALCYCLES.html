Neuroscience bears out the fact that neuronal networks can physically produce cycles due to the directional nature of a neuron (from dendrite to axon). These take the form of 2 or more neurons connected in an actual loop, it can even work within one neuron called an autapse which is a synapse that connects a neuron to itself; these have been modelled demonstrating oscillatory behaviour in the neuron. However science is yet to confirm the experiential correlates of neural cycles or autapses, leaving me free to speculate...</p>
