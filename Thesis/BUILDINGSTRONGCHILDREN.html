Something to be learned from Peterson is that a greater focus on the well-documented evidence of disadvantage and discrimination, rather than outcomes might help promote more efficient, earlier intervention programs, so that resources are not wasted simply repairing damage. This needs to include a much more costly preventative approach. Outcomes might then be useful as a relative (to other measures, not other demographics) measure of effectiveness. But currently the playing field is so unbalanced that outcomes can't hope to be measured fairly.<br></p>
