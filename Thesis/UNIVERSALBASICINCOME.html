In 1974, the city of Dauphin, Canada guaranteed basic income. The program ran successfully for 4 years until the government changed and abolished it. 25 years later researcher Evelyn Forget found those who participated were richer, smarter and healthier, school performance improved substantially, hospitalisation decreased by 8.5%, domestic violence stats went down, as did mental health complaints. The only people who worked a little less were new mothers and students who stayed in school longer. Other experiments from the US to India have confirmed these results. Rutger Bregman explains that the costs associated with child poverty are 500 billion and yet it would cost 175 billion to fund UBI.</p>
