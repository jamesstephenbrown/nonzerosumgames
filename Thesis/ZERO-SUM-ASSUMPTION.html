There is, even for many secularists, a sense of divine justice, karma, just desserts, the calm before the storm, comeuppance, that you can't have your cake an eat it too. These assumptions are responsible for a great many abdications of effort, and are a result of a zero-sum assumption that you can't get something without giving something else up. To a certain extent this is correct, often sacrifice is necessary to achieve something, but that doesn't mean that we should equivocate. To assume that capitalism will always balance because of some notion of Karma, is equally flawed, it is possible for a system to live in a perpetual state of dominance and servitude, and that the meek may never inherit the earth. Why though? How is the imbalance perpetuated?<br></p>
