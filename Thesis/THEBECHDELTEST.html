And on a personal note, I have to thank Pixar and Disney, for finally putting their films through The Bechdel Test; where two women must talk with each other about something other than a male character. Hollywood has begun to employ a healthy weighting towards strong female characters rather than limiting stereotypes that still pervade day-to-day life with a young daughter.</p>
