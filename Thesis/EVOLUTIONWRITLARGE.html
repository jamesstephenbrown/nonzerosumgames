I have a hunch that, as we see in many growing systems, there is an inteplay of <a href ="DETERMINEDRANDOMNESS.html">randomness and determinism</a></p>, that results in natural selection. It's my understanding that these two opposites are the requisite building blocks of anything meaningful and ordered - and, without the other, randomness or determinism alone produce nothing. It is by this logic that the interplay between the uncertainty of quantum mechanics coupled with the deterministic forces of physics are the prerequisites for emergence on a cosmic scale, evolution writ large.</p>
