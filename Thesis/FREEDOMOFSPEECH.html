It is important to level some proportionate criticism of the anti-free speech culture arising in some universities and companies who would otherwise think of themselves as "liberal". If we do not trust that, given all the facts, people will come to the correct conclusions, then we undermine the basis of argument and self-questioning. For this reason, an axiom of freedom of speech for all seems appropriate and it is disappointing that students in universities shout down even moderate speakers, and that government officials in NZ feel the need to ban controversial speakers like Stephan Molyneux and Lauren Southern from venues. All this does is takes a person with a bad argument and gives them one point in their favour (that their freedom of speech is being attacked) which strengthens their own platform.</p>
