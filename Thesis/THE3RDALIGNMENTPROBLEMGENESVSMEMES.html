The classic <a href ="ALIGNMENTPROBLEMS.html">alignment problem</a> concerns artificial intelligence and a misalignment of values, or implementation of them. This is a subject for another sprawling essay, it is useful to place it on the emergence continuum, to help us make sense of our place in all this. For the purposes of this essay the AGI singularity would constitute the 3rd alignment problem; a future dilemma, rather than the second alignment problem that we will come to shortly, that is the crux of what we need to deal with in the present.<br><br>In "The Red Queen" evolutionary psychologist Matt Ridley proposes...<br><br>"If man has evolved the ability to override his evolutionary imperatives, then there must have been an advantage to his genes in doing so. Therefore, even the emancipation from evolution that we so fondly imagine we have achieved must itself have evolved because it suited the replication of genes."<br><br>Ridley dismisses humanity's sense that we have overridden evolution. I would suggest that he misses a vital point; that the sense that we can "override" evolutionary processes is actually the result of memes competing for dominance. While memes have no doubt benefitted genes substantially in the case of humans, this may not be a sustainable "strategy" on the part of the genes. Memes may turn out to be a more powerful replicator than biological evolution. Currently genes are still necessary to build brains to create memes, but this may not always be the case.</p>
