Over 1.5 days thats 50 day's worth of meals, not including the cost of the food actually being served. Now compare that to Oxfam's 6205 day's worth of meals, or put differently 50 people fed for a day as opposed to Oxfam's 6205 people fed for a day. In conclusion, if you want to contribute as much as possible, you should spend their time earning money and giving it to a charity. <br> <br>So, perhaps efficiency is not a fair argument to use against global charities. And let's not forget, that giving to global charities also creates good will, it connects people to an international community in a very positive way. There is still the personal feedback that one gets from being there in a community giving back and there are positives about this feeling of connectedness that might sustain one's feeling of responsibility to people around them. However science suggests there is a flip-side to this "humbling" feeling of giving directly.</p>
