A pathological loop is where the anxiety itself becomes part of the loop. "I am worthless - my feeling of anxiety confirms this - I am worthless" the bottomless nature of a loop of such a kind which is physiologically reinforced could leave someone thinking that the feeling will never end.<br>Providing that Heidegger was wrong to suggest that anxiety is the authentic self. If the feeling of anxiety is simply associated with perceiving recursive concepts, be they self-destructive loops, gurus' gotchas, the actual experience of falling or the understanding of the infinite regress of consciousness - is there a way to escape this loop without denying it?</p>
