A system in which the primary unit of value is human well-being where capitalism is regulated in such a way as to reflect these values. Essentially it would use capitalism for what it's good for and socialism for what it's good for. As with the taxes above, social values are given appropriate financial value and so are no longer at odds with capitalism, they can live in a frictionless partnership. If the unit of value could be quantified then new niches of opportunity would open up every time someone was in need.<br></p>
