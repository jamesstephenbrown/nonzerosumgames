This term is an attempt to shift perspectives in the equality debate. Jordan Peterson lampoons the desired goal of Equality of Outcome or "Equity" as a world where "every single organisation has 50% women and 50% men, doesn't matter if the men and women differ in their intrinsic preferences, which, by the way, they do". The ideal is that these men are being paid equally, where their governing leadership is directly representative of the demographic distribution in the population, and where educational outcomes are homogenous across all ethnic groups. Peterson claims "Post-modernists" advocate that any discrepancy in outcome is due solely to systemic prejudice; for them "there's no hierarchy that's not based on power".<br></p>
