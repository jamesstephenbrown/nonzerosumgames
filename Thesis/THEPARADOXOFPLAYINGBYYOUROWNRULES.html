Life is easy if we play by our own rules. This seems true enough, but we still must create rules, and live by them, to create a rule that changes on a whim is no rule at all. Another aspect of self-help that I have found fruitful is the celebration of self- discipline. The reason this is important is that it helps to avoid the pitfalls of decision fatigue and moral licensing - sticking to your own rule is making a decision once and not having to do it over and over, and not having to find the moral rectitude to do-the-right-thing every time. This leaves mental and moral energy free to be spent in the moment. But why?<br><br>Why do we have to impose artificial rules on ourselves?</p>
