Bret Weinstein says that the problem of pursuing Utopia is that, in order to reach perfection in some area, you have to focus on one metric to the detriment of others. George Orwell expresses a similar sentiment.<br><br>"Nearly all creators of utopia have resembled the man who has a toothache and therefore thinks that happiness consists of in not having a tooth ache"<br><br>This is not just a problem of choosing what is the primary metric, because there is also an issue that a primary metric is highly inefficient due to the law of diminishing returns. </p>
