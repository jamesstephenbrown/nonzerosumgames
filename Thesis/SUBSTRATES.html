I take a position that emergence is a fundamental property of the universe in which we find ourselves. That while <a href ="ENTROPY.html">the universe is trying relentlessly and consistently to destroy itself</a> it seems we are the byproducts living on the very consistent substrate of continual destruction. At many levels we can observe phenomena emerging on top of more primitively ordered systems, most obviously the emergence of terrestrial life is by definition impossible without <a href ="GRAVITON.html">gravitational bodies</a> to reside on. The process is so ubiquitous, and can be observed at so many levels it would be fair to call it a law of our universe.</p>
