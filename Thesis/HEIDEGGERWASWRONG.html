While he may have been on to something to describe this realisation as authenticity, and to associate that with a feeling of profound anxiety - it is not necessarily right to say that profoundly anxious is what we are at our core. After all the evolutionary reason for the anxiety has nothing to do with the truth or meaning of the realisation of our authentic self it is simply a reflex that tells us "Get out of this state lest you get lost in it".
