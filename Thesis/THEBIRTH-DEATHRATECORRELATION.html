However, high birthrates are tied to the infant mortality. Statistics show that after infant mortality drops, there is a period of population growth, but this is followed by a dramatic drop in the birthrate. Research has shown that the causal relationship is in this correlation is that infant mortality and the factors that lead to high infant mortality drives the birth rate. So, if we want to stem overpopulation in the developing world, we actually need to accelerate the developments and protections that will lead to lower infant mortality.<br></p>
