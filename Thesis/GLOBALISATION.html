25 years ago when Nike and Reebok became pariahs for moving their factories to sweat-shops in China and India, this was seen as an act of colonial greed, exploiting the disadvantaged. And in a case by case basis it was, but it turned out to be an equalising force in economics around the world, lifting third world countries out of poverty, elevating them to real players in the world economy. The victims, ironically were the western workers who lost their jobs. Let's not feel too sorry for the entitled western job market though. Western workers lost their jobs because they were accustomed to a higher income and standard of living.<br><br>Many on the left, who may have been heartened to hear about the benefits that globalisation brought to the less fortunate overseas, have remained ignorant of this fact. Meanwhile the guilt of the images of sweat-shop workers left them with an impression of globalisation as a wholly negative project. Meanwhile working-class people on the right became aware of the detrimental effect it had on their livelihood. This forged an unlikely alliance of ignorant leftists and entitled working class conservatives against the blight of globalisation.</p>
