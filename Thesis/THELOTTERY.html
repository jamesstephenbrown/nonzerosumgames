Imagine you wake up one morning to a phone call, you've won a million dollars in the weekly lotto draw, but you don't remember entering. The operator informs you that the government has, in a bizarre act of wealth redistribution, put your tax dollars towards a single lottery ticket every week for every person in the country. Somehow you have been completely ignorant of this fact for over a decade. You receive your cheque and are handed an NDA, the program is completely secretive, no one knows about this lottery until they win it.<br><br>What are the chances you would win such a competition? Well, since the lottery has been running for 10 years, your country has a population of, let's say 10 million, all of the money each week is allotted to the winner and no one can win twice, you have a 1 / 5000 chance of having won it by now. Not great odds. However, from the perspective of everyone who is aware of the lottery (the 2000 winners so far), the chances of winning are 100%.<br><br>We have no idea how many entries we've had in the cosmic lottery, but we know that all the other entries that did not win the prize of consciousness are not aware they haven't won. The fact that we live in a universe where there exist beings that perceive the universe, is actually unremarkable, on the contrary it is inescapable. If there were to be other possible universes that didn't contain agents capable of perception, they would never be perceived.</p>
