First of all, what is the problem we're trying to solve here? Sure self-help has grown into a booming economy by giving bottled solutions to a world with unrealistic expectations, one might say, but why are solutions necessary to begin with? In much of the world we're not having trouble surviving anymore, and we certainly don't need to reproduce any more than we are currently, so why has evolution programmed us to have so much anxiety in this situation? The unfortunate reality is that missed opportunities and unanticipated risks were a matter of life or death in our evolutionary past, which has hardwired restlessness. We are programmed to ask "What next?" regardless of our past achievements.</p>
