Outrage is often used as a tool to bully others into adopting a view, in the place of reasoned argumentation, and so it usually tends to undermine the validity of the case being made. At the same time there is room for moral outrage. We have to appreciate that words are not purely academic, they communicate sometimes insulting and dangerous messages. Communication to a person that something is not just incorrect, but also morally wrong is something that might be best communicated by revealing the emotional response you have, after all, subjective experience is moral currency. </p>
