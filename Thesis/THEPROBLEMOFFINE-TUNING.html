When we apply anthropocentrism and assume that perception is only as we understand it to be, we fail to conceive of other forms of consciousness and so we marvel at a fine-tuned universe with "laws" responsible for the existence of our own perception. Religious apologists will claim that the universe is so perfectly fine-tuned for our existence that this fact only be explained by an intelligent <a href ="OURFIRSTANDWORSTATTEMPT.html">god</a>.<br>But if we grant that other forms of perception are possible and could be formed by other physical laws then we have no way of measuring the probability of conscious existence.</p>
