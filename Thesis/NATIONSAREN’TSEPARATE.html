Globalisation has revealed a loophole in the assumption of nationhood. When a nation can exploit the labour (and the exploitative labour practices) of another country, without providing support, we create a hypocritical economy. If we appreciate that people are equal and are products largely of their circumstances, then we should protect the rights of and help improve the situation of those in other countries. The localist camp may have a knee jerk reaction to this, and it is important to hear objections.</p>
