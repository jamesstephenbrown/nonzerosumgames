IDENTIFYING WITH OUR DECISIONS</h1><p>

When you say that you have no free will, we can view the issue more clearly if we establish what “you” means. In order to understand why the illusion of free will is not entirely false, you need to look at “you” as the entirety of your experience. So, while you have your genetics invisibly influencing your behaviour you also have all of the memories and heuristics developed through experience firing as you manifest your action - your association of that process with your yourself is actually quite accurate when you define “you” as the sum of your experiences. Your experiences (you) are, in this way, significantly influencing your decisions, even if they are doing so pre-consciously.</p>
