Depopulation does not require a direct policy like China's one child policy. The greatest tool in stemming over-population is ... education. Mixing of cultures across borders through globalisation and travel will reveal the benefits of ... education for all cultures, and this superior value will become ubiquitous. This is an absolute non-zero game in which everyone benefits. This also makes overpopulation a sort of horse-shit problem, that is solved by solving the primary problem of equal opportunities.</p>
