In order to tackle this existential threat we will need to employ both the power of government policing and of capitalist innovation. Curbing economic hoarding (through the previous taxes) will encourage capital to fuel new renewable resources, which have economic benefits outside of environmental concerns (they have greater growth potential to reach a cheaper price eventually) and tends towards energy independence, not just for nations but for individuals breaking down centuries old fuel monopolies, be they middle eastern states, national governments, or power companies.<br><br>But capitalism will only work in service of a greater product and the environment is not currently a paying customer. With climate change accelerating, we need to give this issue its due and pay for it, not in the form of government controls, but by adding a monetary value to the environment, so that it factors as a cost in the balance sheet of any company that exploits it. So, some more taxes.<br><br>	TAX 5. Pollution / Carbon taxes</p>
