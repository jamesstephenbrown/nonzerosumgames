CREATIVE PROGRESS</h1><p>

On an individual level we naturally find struggle through progress. This is why many people get satisfaction from their jobs, because good jobs generally have, built into them, a sustainable progress model, either by design or evolution. The mind builds habits and routines that become automatic and reassigns conscious awareness to new creative problems, not having this results in boredom, having too much results in overload. Creative pursuits can also fill this purpose, or<br>education - the model of practice, mastery and extension can keep the brain at the sweet spot of progress, which James Clear in “Atomic Habits” says is at about 104%, slightly outside what we can do automatically.<br><br>These however are an extension of effort that is only fulfilling a personal need. Is there a way to shape society in a way that creates a non-zero-sum situation that uses this effort in a way that fulfils us and at the same time contributes something to society? As with happiness and wealth there is again the option of increase taxation on wealth - in particular those who inherit wealth (increasing struggle for those who have the least struggle) and using that to alleviate regressive struggle at the bottom end. As with happiness, this will put people within an optimal range of character building experience, and may even help people feel they are living a life of more purpose, with a more heroic narrative. It’s a win win, but what would it look like.</p>
