When Nietzsche claimed "That which does not kill us, makes us stronger" he was unaware that he himself would be slowly weakened over a number of years by debilitating strokes, paralysis and mental illness before eventually succumbing to pneumonia. And the metaphor also remains incomplete in life. While there are challenges that build character, and struggles that spur us on to greater things, there is always the flip side, the psychologically debilitating experiences, trauma, chronic self-doubt, self-flagellation and hatred, addiction and simple bad luck.</p>
