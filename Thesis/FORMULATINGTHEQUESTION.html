Before discovering answers we must formulate the question "What should I do now?".<br>"WHAT" suggests the answer is not self-evident and yet might be reasoned about "SHOULD" implies value and choice, both of which need to be interrogated.<br>"I" refers to conscious experience and self-awareness.<br>"DO" refers to the action determined at any moment.<br>"NOW?" means in the present moment; fleeting and intangible and yet also eternal as it is forever "now".</p>
