No one is under the illusion they can choose their own desires, just try it; Can you want to watch grass grow for 10 hours straight? Can you choose to enjoy drinking a bottle of vinegar? Can you choose to desire brussels sprouts? No one can will these desires into existence, no one!<br><br>Because we know that we do not choose our desires it can seem as though our sense of free will falls into infinite regress. However, this is a straw-man. The common conception of free will is associated with another definition of "will" that relates to one's power of control over one's actions when faced with their desires. The free will in question is not to not want an ice cream, only not to have an ice cream. Our desires are where any free decision bottoms out, not as in it becomes meaningless but in fact where it gets its value as value can only be measured in terms of conscious experience.</p>
