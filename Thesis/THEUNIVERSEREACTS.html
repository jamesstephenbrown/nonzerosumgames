So, we are here, the universe perceiving itself. And this has been a long time coming, in fact the ability to react to the environment precedes the development of brains. First bacteria had large proteins called ion channels that allowed them to selectively transmit electrically charged cells called ions in and out, effectively communicating inputs from their environment. So, neurons are not the only examples of information transferral, they are just the most effective we know of, the first that have really had a good think about the universe. Brains gave their hosts the capacity to build predictive models of the world, and coupled with a nervous system allowed them to react accordingly.</p>
