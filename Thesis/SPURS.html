There are two types of spur. The spur on the rider's boot that stings the horse's side, and the heel spur; a calcium growth on the underside of your foot. Both are nasty business but only one has any utility, for there is a subtle difference between them. In the case of the riding spur, relief is gained through action, whereas relief from the heel spur is gained through inaction. While, the challenge of climbing a mountain, or suffering defeat in a football game may be a riding spur, and good advice for the spoiled rich kid, the sort of chronic poverty that crushes family units and leads to crime, violence and drug abuse is a heel spur.<br><br>So, when we speak of hardship, struggle and competition "spurring" action we have to ask, in the particular case, what type of spur are we talking about?</p>
