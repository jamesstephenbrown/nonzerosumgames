There is an allegory to the cognitive dissonance we have already dealt with and that is the natural extension of rights and liberties across the globe. How can we, as a society, claim to have superior values that we want to "protect" if we are at the same time happy to abuse those rights in people outside the sphere of the nation or the "1st world" when we buy cheap goods from countries that don't extend the same rights to their workforce?</p>
