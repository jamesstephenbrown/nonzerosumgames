Heralds crying that the politics of left and right is over may be eating their words as the partisan nature of politics really comes to a head in America and Europe. However, there is something to be said for a shifting towards an argument between Globalists and Localists. You will find proponents of these on both sides of the traditional left and right divide; Donald Trump in the localist camp, Obama and Bush in the globalist camp. Russell Brand and Alex Jones in the localist camp, Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro in the globalist camp.</p>
