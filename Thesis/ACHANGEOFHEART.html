I have had a strong feeling that we are faced with a spectrum of people, who divide quite neatly in the middle into people who care about the well being of others and people who are selfish. But through studying this I've discovered it is more complex and yet more soluble. I now find myself holding the position that there is a spectrum, but it goes from people who are more or less suggestible through fear, and those divide neatly in the middle. Meanwhile the divide between caring people and selfish people is actually more asymmetrical in favour of caring people. But it only takes a very small group of people who are strategically selfish to manipulate those who are prone to suggestion through fear.</p>
