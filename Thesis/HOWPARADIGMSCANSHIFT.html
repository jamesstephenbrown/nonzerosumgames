The #MeToo movement combined a viral technology (hash-tagging) with a viral imperative to "tell your story" that effectively crowd-sourced the most tried and true method of spreading ideas; stories. There is a lesson to be learned here about how to shift political opinion, it's about creating a structure that promotes stories that reinforce a message. And this doesn't need to be done cynically, as with the #MeToo movement, the message needed to heard, the stories were genuine and the world has changed.</p>
