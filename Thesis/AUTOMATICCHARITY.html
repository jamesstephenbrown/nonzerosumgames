Automating our charitable giving is one potential way to get around our own tendency to moral licensing by becoming blind to our own virtuousness. It is easy to set and forget a donation, and forgetting our monthly giving reduces our propensity to moral licensing. Also, because the recipients are on the other side of the world we get no reverence from them and no affirmation of our own righteousness. This might leave us with enough compassion to give to the next homeless person we pass by on the street, or to vote for governments that provide services to those less fortunate than ourselves. This would be a way of consistently pushing the needle towards good, rather than living with an internal moral pendulum, making us truly good people. I would hope that we had also evolved a way to sense this quality in others, so that our accumulative good actions in the world have some affect on how we are perceived and trusted by others.</p>
