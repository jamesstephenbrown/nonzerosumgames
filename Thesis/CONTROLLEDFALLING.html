There is a fleeting sense of falling in this state, and that for Heidegger is authenticity. Existentialists such as Heidegger and Sartre explain the human condition as always escaping the fall by means of fixing on an internal fictional role (a winner, loser, optimist) or externally enforced role (presenter, team member, parent, leader, surgeon, butcher, baker, candlestick maker) that allows the da-sein (that which does the being) to go back to "being" in the world.</p>
