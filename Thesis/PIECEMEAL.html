In "The Open Society and Its Enemies" Karl Popper advocated for "Piecemeal social engineering" rather than wholesale revolution; or "Utopian social engineering". He describes this as...<br><br>"... the difference between the only method of improving matters which has so far been really successful, at any time, and in any place, and a method which, wherever it has been tried, has led only to the use of violence in place of reason..."<br><br>Unfortunately, now as then, populist stories motivate action better than rational discourse and because fear drives people towards conservatism, this benefits the right. In addition, when radicalised, leftists find themselves incapable of siding with a centre left-leaning government that would provide a steady path toward progress. Many left radicals neglect to vote and right wing governments are elected, reversing progress.</p>
