The serious philosopher, determined to live by reason alone, has two options; either she frees herself of the illusion that she is free and in so doing so concedes that she is not free, or she frees herself from the illusion in such a way that she transcends determinism itself. Both options leave her no way to understand the infinitely complex process of determinism and therefore no way to understand the behaviour of herself and others. So, she returns to first principles and rediscovers the patterns that first lead her to believe she had free will. So, she learns, once more, to live as if she and those around her have it.</p>
