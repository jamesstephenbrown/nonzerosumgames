With the acknowledgment of inescapably value-laden experience we might be tempted to say that good is pleasure and bad is pain. To a large extent this philosophically controversial view is actually quite accurate, in as much as it is accurate, it is also trivial a <a href ="DEEPITIES.html">deepity</a>.<br><br>What people mean when they speak about a good person is actually an altruistic person, someone who is unwilling to compromise the wellbeing of others in seeking their own goals and / or someone who spreads happiness, bad people are the contrary. So, good is rooted in <a href ="INESCAPABLYVALUE-LADENEXPERIENCES.html">inescapably value-laden experiences</a> but is relative to others; a moral agent's behaviour towards moral concerns. All this was enough to give us nature red in tooth and claw in the wild, it is not enough of a foundation on which to build a moral society.</p>
