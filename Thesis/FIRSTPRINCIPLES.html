When embarking on an exploration of ideas, it's important to return to first principles and recognise (there are always some) founding assumptions.<br>Asking questions itself assumes a number of preconditions. First of all questions can only exist in a world where questioners exist, questioners can only ask questions in a world where knowledge is possible and answers to those questions can only be meaningfully reached in a world where logic can be relied on. If one does not assume that we live in a world that satisfies these conditions then exploration is meaningless.<br>1. Conscious agents exist<br>2. Knowledge is possible<br>3. Logic is reliable<br>In choosing to have a meaningful exploration - I concede these axioms.</p>
