At the same time there is a targeted attack on democracy mainly originating from Russia which you can clearly see in the reporting of their curated propaganda channel RT. This channel and the hordes of bots and hackers who sought to affect Brexit and the 2016 US election systematically criticise democracy itself, and take their own work; Brexit and Trump as examples of democracy failing. Again this, as with much else that is driven by trickery and political tactics drives the political needle to the right.</p>
