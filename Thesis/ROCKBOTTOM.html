Self-help stories often take the form of an internal revolution, in which a person hits "rock bottom" and builds themselves up from scratch. And like political revolutions, they are problematic. George Bush is an example of someone who hit rock bottom through alcoholism and then built himself up through becoming a born again Christian. These internal revolutions do happen sometimes, and when they do the results are not always good for the people surrounding the individual in question... What's more, these redemption stories are exceptional and obscure the fact that many people who hit rock bottom simply stay there and drag others down with them.</p>
