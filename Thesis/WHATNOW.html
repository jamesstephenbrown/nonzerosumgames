	<h1>WHAT NOW?</h1>

		<p>Good question, this is a question that is on my mind almost all the time, it kinda has to be.<br>

		</p><p>This question is in many ways the brain's <a href ="EVOLUTIONARYPURPOSE.html">evolutionary purpose</a>, it's what differentiates us from the plants. It's a question that is always at the very edge of our experience, whether consciously or not we are always asking "What now?". It is the question we hope to control. It is this question that drives me to write this non-linear <a href ="MODULARESSAY.html">essay</a>; the desire to live consciously, perhaps even free. #LoftyAF</p>
