Heisenberg's uncertainty principle posits that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain ratios of particle dimensions such as position vs momentum can be known. While this is often confused with the "observer effect" it is in fact a fundamental property of quantum systems, and not about observational interference. As the activities of the brain take place at the quantum scale as explained by <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830500-300-is-quantum-physics-behind-your-brains-ability-to-think/" target=blank>Matthew Fisher</a> it has been proposed that randomness may play a role in thought.</p>
