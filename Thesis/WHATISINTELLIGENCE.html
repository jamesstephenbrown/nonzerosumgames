To look at the brain as a computer helps us see that the brain is multidimensional, and doesn't just do one thing. When we look at how we make machines "smart" we take two general approaches. One is prescriptive where we set rules in code that execute in the program entirely predictably, which is analogous to a cognition, the part of our brain that understands can explain an answer, based on logic. The other is machine learning which uses artificial neural nets to form answers that are surprisingly accurate but have no explanatory power, much like our sense of intuition. It seems that the holy grail of artificial intelligence is to bridge the gap between these two methods in a way that we feel our own brains do.<br><br>But do we really do this? Or do we simply rationalise our decisions after the fact?<br><br><br><br></p>
