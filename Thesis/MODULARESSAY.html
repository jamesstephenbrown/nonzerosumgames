A modular essay is a hybrid format between a linear essay and website - it is essentially a map of ideas. The reason I've built this essay in this way is because I am intending for it to be an exploration, which grows as I do. I also understand that stories are, by necessity, selective and that process of curation in at odds with open inquiry.</p>
