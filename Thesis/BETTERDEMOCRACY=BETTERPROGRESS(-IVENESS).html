Better campaigning, less political influence and more fair and democratic representation will result in a shift left. But unlike the political pendulum, this will not result in an unmanageable swing to the left, that will inevitably swing back. As long as the conditions remain healthy the centre will shift sustainably to a new point of balance across individual autonomy, economic growth, wealth distribution, diversity and social mobility. This will be a system freer from asymmetrical interests, and we will see greater non-zero-sum gains.</p>
