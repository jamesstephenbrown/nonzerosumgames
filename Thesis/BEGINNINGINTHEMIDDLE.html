Because, as we have explored, experience is inescapably value-laden, it is as solid a foundation as nature or God. The centre of the meaning is only seen as absurd or arbitrary if we imagine that it was once designed, when we understand that it was never such we understand that we begin the story of meaning in the middle rather than at the prime move. Because causality moves in one direction does not mean that meaning must. Take for example a deadline, the actions you perform in order to hit a deadline are given meaning and purpose by something in the future, the cause moves in one direction through time, the meaning moves where it pleases.</p>
