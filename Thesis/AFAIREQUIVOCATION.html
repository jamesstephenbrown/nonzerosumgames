I have always found the assumption that because I believe one thing, I therefore believe another unrelated thing, to be a barrier to independent thinking. However, I think it is important to acknowledge that some equivocations are fairer than others. For instance, I claimed the issue of low-choice high-choice prejudice in relation to IQ was a "related issue" to that of right wing activism in relation left wing activism. The relatedness is due to a common factor, and that is IQ. As Satoshi Kanazawa demonstrates; mean IQ level correlates with political alignment.<br><br>"respondents who identify themselves as â€˜very conservative' in their early adulthood have a mean adolescent IQ of 94.82, whereas those who identify themselves as "very liberal" have a mean adolescent IQ of 106.42."<br><br>The reason intelligence is a meaningful vector to focus on, is because we understand that intelligence is literally what we use to form our political views. It seems that those who have more intelligence to spare are able to appreciate possibilities outside the familiar. For others they might cling to guns, lower taxes, tribal affiliations, coal mining jobs, border walls and other views under the general umbrella of conservatism. In the same way, those with greater cognitive ability are more likely to make fair judgements about people based on those people's choices, rather than adhering to ingrained prejudice.</p>
