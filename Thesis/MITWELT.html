Heidegger saw humans as "thrown" into a world and that consciousness was contingent on a mitwelt (with-world) that we are conscious of. Our thrown nature gives us a trajectory that limits the scope of our experiences gives us something to push off of. You can look at hunger as one of these trajectories; we are born in a body that needs food progressively as it burns energy and that motivates us to take action.</p>
