The reason the west thrived over the last millennium and most acutely in the 20th Century is not just because freedom is more enjoyable than subjugation, but because, as Yuval Noah Harari describes, it had developed "values, myths, judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures" over centuries7 that could not be simply copied, they had to evolve piecemeal. This is analogous to developing sustainable habits as an individual. So, instead of trying to change the system, perhaps we should start enriching the culture with the stories and values of a better more progressive world - this has always been set in motion by philosophers and creators of entertainment long before the populous catch up. Now, with social media, virality has opened new opportunities for everyone to shape these narratives, which is a blessing and a curse. This highlights the need for philosophers to remain active and lead, and for content creators to become more philosophical in their outlook.</p>
