Full disclosure I am a "capitalist" of sorts, in that I believe in the right of people to be rewarded for effort and wise investments. However I believe that can be achieved in a non-zero-sum game where inequality is curtailed through fair redistribution, and the system continues perpetually in balance. The Capitalism of Adam Smith is a beautiful thing; modern society's original non-zero-sum game, a counter-intuition that freedom of trade and competition can benefit a society as a whole. But this is a naive economy of businesses happily selling goods and services and employing people. Adam Smith never envisioned multinational companies based in the US, and paying taxes in Bermuda or a labyrinthian financial industry profiting from economic obfuscation. It was never a panacea, Adam Smith never claimed that this capitalism would take care of unprofitable enterprises like paying your medical bills, or feeding the homeless. So, while I am a capitalist of sorts, the "Capitalists" I refer to are those at the upper end of an increasingly out of balance system, who are seeking to perpetuate this power imbalance; leading to a zero sum game of a few winners and and many losers.<br></p>
