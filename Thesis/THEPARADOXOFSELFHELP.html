There is an industry of gurus out there claiming to have the answers to all life's problems, how to grow those branches to your desired riches, relationships and accolades. But one problem I always have with these gurus is, by and large, the vehicle by which they themselves have overcome self-doubt and narcissism and gained riches in their own lives, is by becoming self-help gurus. In other words, by expressing themselves to adoring crowds and capitalising on the sea of self- doubt and narcissism in the general population. The structure is one of a spiritual Ponzi scheme.</p>
