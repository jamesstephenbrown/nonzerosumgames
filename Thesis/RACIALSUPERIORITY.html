In his 1994 book "The Bell Curve" Charles Murray presented research that claimed IQ differences between different racial groups. Aside from the obvious objection that this sort of research has a dark history, there are two other good objections that can be levelled at Murray. First of all researchers cannot possibly account for other contributory factors, and secondly even if the research was correct, the political stance of Murray and many that cite his research - which is invariably against social support, is at odds with the conclusion.<br></p>
