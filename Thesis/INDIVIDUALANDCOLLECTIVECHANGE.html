How do you change a collective perspective? It seems as though there are two options, by changing individuals or changing the masses by force or coercion by a central authority, but virality might be a third way. Viruses are able to be defined at both an individual and a collective perspective. Religion is a good example, where despite borders and laws or individual arguments, a strong religion with enough effective mechanisms for self-propagation can spread. Religion spread through stories passed down, and by imperatives built in to the stories to propagate them further.</p>
