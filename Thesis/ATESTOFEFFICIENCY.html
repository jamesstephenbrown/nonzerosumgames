How inefficient is Oxfam? Let's say I'm a middle-aged, middle class worker in Auckland, I earn NZ$50/hr. Each month, I give $50 to Oxfam and once a year I also take one and a half days off work to volunteer at a soup kitchen. Both the donations and the volunteering cost me 1.5 days income; $600. The volunteering I do, gives me a great feeling of self- worth and I make some positive relationships and feed some people who otherwise would have been hungry. This creates some good will in my community. The $600 over the year for Oxfam equates to about $500 of actual humanitarian aid. According to The Life You Can Save website this donation will either provide school meal programs to 17 children for an entire year, build 12 latrines to protect the health of families displaced by natural disasters and conflict or provide 6 households with seeds and tools for farming.<br>Which day and a half is better spent, the donation to Oxfam or the day and a half at the soup kitchen? Lets take those 17 otherwise starving children, every day for a year, that's 6205 days worth of meals - quite a day at the soup kitchen! For reference chef Bian Tagal states on the forum Quora that a very basic cooking set up in a student housing cooperative that he managed in Austin Texas took an average of 3 staff cooking and cleaning full time to serve 100 tenants their daily meals. Assuming that a soup kitchen runs at the same efficiency, then a volunteer is providing meals for an average of 33 people a day.</p>
