We also have to live with ourselves, we have to look at ourselves in the mirror, and seek to resolve our inner lives. After all, evolution has also discovered some of these non-zero sum games, and has accordingly built into us empathy, which is central to our intelligence and is as <a href ="INESCAPABLYVALUE-LADENEXPERIENCES.html">inescapably value-laden</a> as pleasure and pain. So, to deny this instinct, and to live with the logical double standard of valuing your own life at the expense of others, is also bad for your brain, a state of cognitive and emotional dissonance is not healthy.<br></p>
