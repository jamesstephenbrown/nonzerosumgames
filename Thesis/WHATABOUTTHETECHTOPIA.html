The existence of Horseshit Problems; those that are overcome indirectly by the development of technology, have given some technophiles hope that better technology will solve all our problems. However, horseshit in New York was a very isolated, practical issue, where as issues of politics, cultural narratives and the individual are more perennial. So, while I plan to explore the effect of future technology in another essay, it is fair to worry that if we cannot sort out our perennial issues they will only pollute our technology as well.</p>
