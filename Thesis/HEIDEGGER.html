My understanding of Heidegger's conception of authenticity was living in profound anxiety, as if falling into the void. Anxiety becomes a bridge between a being's role in the world and the authentic self - aware of its infinitesimal significance. It works both ways in that a logical or philosophical epiphany of one's lack of control, significance and purpose evokes a profound anxiety, but also that it is in moments of extreme anxiety that we connect with our authentic self. Anxiety is after all synonymous with self-consciousness.</p>
