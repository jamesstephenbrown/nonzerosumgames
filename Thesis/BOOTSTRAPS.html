Without some strong and consistent force in someone's life against which they can shape struggles into character, people can simply become a victim of their experiences. The stories of great underdog successes, often miss out or underplay the actual fulcrum of their self-building; their trust fund (Clint Eastwood), their family history or name (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), their parents' expectations, their privilege, their safety net (Elon Musk), even their one loving family member - Some people who have none of those things and others don't have the right combination.<br></p>
