Some might take this reasoning that compassion for anyone who chooses not to end their own life is redundant - claiming they must be happy, as they have chosen life. I would propose that there is a gulf of misery which Camus did not account for where life is simply less fearsome than death - we have not evolved to needlessly end our lives. So, while we might derive, in some sense, life's inherent value to humans from the fact that most of us choose life over death - we cannot induce that we are therefore all content, there may be many people living in the gulf of misery.</p>
