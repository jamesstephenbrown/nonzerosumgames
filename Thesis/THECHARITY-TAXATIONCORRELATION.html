Ayn Rand would say the answer lies in charity, people will be compelled by self-interest to give to the wretched poor who are essentially ruining the view. There is also a common misconception - propounded by libertarians that if you decrease taxes - charitable giving will fill the gaps. This is contrary to statistics which show that higher taxes actually increase charitable giving. I would propose that this is not just because of the incentive of tax write-offs for donations, but also, a higher tax rate communicates a greater responsibility to and awareness of those less fortunate than oneself - making charity part of our social expectations.</p>
