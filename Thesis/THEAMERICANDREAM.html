The American Dream Report, a study of the Economic Mobility Project, found that Americans surveyed were more likely than citizens of other countries to agree with statements like: "People get rewarded for intelligence and skill" and "People get rewarded for their efforts" and less likely to agree with statements like "Coming from a wealthy family is 'essential' or 'very important' to getting ahead," "Income differences in my country are too large" or "It is the responsibility of government to reduce differences in income."<br></p>
