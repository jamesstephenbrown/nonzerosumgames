We are inescapably meso-scopic beings and are inescapably meso-centric in our outlook. We can observe the microscopic and macroscopic world only by scaling them to the meso-scopic scale. In the same way, we cannot interpret the past or the future without bringing it to the present. To find meaning we must acknowledge that it is our conscious experience that is the scale at which we recognise meaning and that in order to find meaning we must do so in terms of conscious experience. This does not preclude objectivity because, although we are constrained in our perspective we can and do triangulate on objectivity by means of our binocular vision, our temporal awareness, consensus, logic and the scientific method. Can we effectively turn this lens on ourselves?</p>
