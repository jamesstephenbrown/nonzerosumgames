Placing monetary value on social goods feels a little Orwellian for many people's tastes. For one, who determines the "social good"? I would contend that given the system as it stands, we already vote for what are the social goods, and we already capitulate to rules that determine our behaviour, and we are better for it. If I could be coerced to eat healthier and live longer with no additional effort myself, would I chose to? Yes. Given a democratic say in what we are incentivised to do, I personally don't see a problem with a system that seeks to use coercion for my own good. The alternative is what we have at present, where we are coerced by a market for which profit is the primary motive. This motive is not just a-moral but might actually be at odds with our welfare. Having some say in how we are coerced, through ascribing financial value to social goods, might be the most empowering political move ever made.<br></p>
