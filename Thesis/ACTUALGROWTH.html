Evolution has primed us to use relative measures of worth. In the situation of running away from a lion, or attracting a mate, it only matters whether you are better than the next person. The joke is as follows; Two men are faced with a lion, one turns to the other and asks "Why are you putting your sneakers on? You can't outrun a lion" the other says "I don't need to outrun the lion, I only need to outrun you".<br><br>We seek environments where we have advantage, rather than environments where we are at a disadvantage. This can mean we avoid unfamiliar environments or environments where we are relatively inferior, because they make us feel inadequate. In reality, in entering the challenging environment we are exactly as we were. And yet we are no longer in the jungle, many of our fearful instincts and feelings of inadequacy are unjustified. On a purely selfish level, this is actually an opportunity to game your own system in order to attain personal growth. A situation where your peers are stronger than you will trigger your natural relative measures and make improvement much more likely. For instance, I rock climb at a gym where everyone is excellent, it makes me feel inadequate but objectively I improve faster.</p>
