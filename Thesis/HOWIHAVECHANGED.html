While the essay begins with some bombastic conclusions (no piece of media is complete these days without some click-bait) I did seek to learn and change my views through writing this. And I have.<br><br>First of all I have learned that I need to be kinder to others and myself. People are products of a highly complex mix of environment, genes, fears, irrationality and of course rationality, courage, choices and hopes. I am one of these people too, and it is important, to set up societal systems and our own individual systems to make the most of our potential. This means working with irrationality, laziness and fear in ourselves and others, rather than only tolerating the virtuous aspects of people. This will not only be more effective in the moment, but will actually help ourselves and others overcome those flaws. Part of this is the discovery of the effectiveness of habit driven achievement over goal driven achievement, and that this analogy maps nicely on to society also. This in turn has given me a greater appreciation for the utility of virtue ethics, which I had often discounted as insufficient to really drive change. I would have said I was a fairly puritanical Utilitarian before, and while I still think the utilitarian calculus is important, virtue ethics aligns better with habit driven and piecemeal change.<br><br>Every section of this essay has shaped and developed my views, and through this process I have noticed myself becoming a clearer thinker, decision maker and communicator in general. If you too are lost in your ideas, I recommend writing them down.</p>
