What profound truths do is change the way in which we interpret observed patterns in nature, resulting in a paradigm shift. It does not change the observations themselves, and much of our mundane action in the world is in response to observation, not paradigms. A paradigm shift often changes the perspective of everything, so much so that, practically speaking, changes in different areas can in fact cancel each other out and return many of the mundane operations of humans back to "normal".</p>
