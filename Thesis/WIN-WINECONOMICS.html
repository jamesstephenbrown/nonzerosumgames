I'd like to throw in some valid kudos for capitalism in this respect. Capitalism, as it was conceived by Adam Smith is, in many respects, a non-zero-sum game. Ideally people compete better in the a capitalist economy if they can offer a win-win situation. I have a lot of cash, you have a lot of couches, if I exchange my cash for your couch, it's a win-win. Because you are a couch specialist, you can produce a couch much more cheaply than I could make the equivalent couch for, you can charge me more than it cost to make and it will still be less that it would have cost me to make it myself.</p>
