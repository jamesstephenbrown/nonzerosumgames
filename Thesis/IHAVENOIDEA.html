I have no idea.<br><br>What I think I know are my opinions about a range of issues tied together by an intuition informed by overarching beliefs and values, but this doesn't satisfy me. Intuition is a blunt instrument and I want to know that those views are built on a strong foundation and that they are consistent. In writing this, I will return, as far as is possible to <a href ="FIRSTPRINCIPLES.html">first principles</a> and hold none of my opinions sacred. My opinions, after all, being a result of my own experiences, are like the <a href ="WHYPEOPLEBELIEVEINGOD.html">inherited religion</a> of someone's parents, why should I trust my opinions above others?</p>
