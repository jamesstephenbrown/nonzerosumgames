There are many situations where a rising tide lifts all boats, and by this I don't mean to reference the trickle down economics of letting the market rule, but rather the betterment of everyone, be it through healthcare, education or security. The benefits of social support policies range from lower death rates, and lower birth rates, lower crime rates, lower drug abuse rates, on a larger scale less war and terrorism. Even for the rich, it means cleaner streets, greater security, and a higher level of conversation.<br></p>
