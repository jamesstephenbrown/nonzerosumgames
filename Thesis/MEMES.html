Richard Dawkins also proposed the idea of memes - cultural ideas that replicate in a similar way to genes. Social constructs such money, laws and science and language itself are "meme factories" that spread ideas because they true, or otherwise consistent and useful. Other meme factories are akin to mind viruses in which the idea spreads not due to its truthfulness or usefulness but because of the internal structure of the idea that exploits some loophole in human psychology to reproduce for its own sake rather than for the advantage of it's host.</p>
