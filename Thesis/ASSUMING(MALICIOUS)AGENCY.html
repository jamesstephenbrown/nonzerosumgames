Because we are wired to sense danger wherever possible, and much of the time our greatest threat is other animals, we also have evolved to sense agency, and particularly malice wherever it could be. This leads to anthropomorphism of nature and all manner of magical thinking; from superstition to religion. It also leaves us with an undue suspicion of others which manifests as everything from social anxiety to xenophobia.</p>
