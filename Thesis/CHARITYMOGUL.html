Some people have a strange suspicion of charities, as if, because they don't feel charitable themselves, they cannot quite trust the motivations of those who do. An argument I heard from a friend was that they didn't want to give to an NGO because of how much they spend on advertising. I wish I had thought to say "Well, have you researched NGOs that don't advertise? Because you'll have to, in order to find one... because they don't advertise". Since this conversation, I've heard the same message repeated - almost to the point of a conspiracy theory that assumes NGOs are simply wolf-like corporations in sheep's clothing. So, I looked into the stats, and was surprised to find just how little high-profile charities spend on advertising. Oxfam, for example, spends 83% of their donations on humanitarian development.</p>
