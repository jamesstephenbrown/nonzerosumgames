Big data, is.. big right now. Steve Lohr's book "Data-ism" looks at how big data is transforming society. Yuval Noah Harari used the term to point to what he sees as an emerging religion that appreciates data flow as a central driving force in the world. While this is an interesting lens through which to view history and think about the future, the mechanism of temes does a similar job, but with a greater sense of continuity with an emergent universe through successive replicators.</p>
