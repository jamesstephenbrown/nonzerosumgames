A common criticism of Utilitarianism is that when looking at issues in isolation, it can lead to absurd results. Take the scenario of a busy hospital that has 5 people on death's door, each urgently needing a different organ transplant. They are all of the blood type A. A healthy young woman walks into the hospital to visit her friend who has just had a baby. She approaches the reception desk and before she has a chance to ask where the maternity ward is, the reception asks "Excuse me miss, do you know your blood type?"... "A... why do you ask?"<br><br>In that moment the receptionist, given a very different set of medical ethics, could make the decision to order hospital security to detain and murder the visitor, and have a surgeon deliver the necessary organs to the 5 people who were, until that time, waiting to die.</p>
