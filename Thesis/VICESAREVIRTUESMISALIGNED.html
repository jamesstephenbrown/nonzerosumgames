A final point on <a href ="VIRTUEETHICS.html">virtues</a> is that in our <a href ="UTILITARIANISM.html">utilitarian</a> calculus we can avail ourselves of evolutionary psychology that bares out Nietzsche's position that...<br><br>"Once you only had passions and called them evil. But now you have only virtues; they grew out of your passions".<br><br>If we acknowledge where our darker desires had utility (in our evolutionary past) we might be able to find new utility for them, or at least forgive ourselves for them while we deny them light.</p>
