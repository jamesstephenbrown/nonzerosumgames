While capitalists have been benefiting from growing inequality, society's unrest has been curtailed by a number of benefits brought to it mainly by democracy and globalisation - however much capitalism would like to take the credit. Women's rights made people feel more progressive through the 80s, but at the same time as women moved into the workplace, somehow family incomes continued to drop to where now it is almost impossible to support even a small family with one income. What was celebrated as a civil rights conquest was actually fulfilling a capitalist imperative - more cheap labour. Meanwhile as wages stagnated we were placated by the production of cheap goods produced by globalisation.</p>
