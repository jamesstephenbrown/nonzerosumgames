If we were to extend evolution from natural selection to a broader technological evolution, we might say that our evolutionary purpose is to create better replicators, in any medium. Perhaps those replicators could even be as ethereal as data, in which case, our purpose in all this would be to create greater and greater processors of data (the Artificial General Intelligence singularity). But we know that this emergent game is an infinite one, and should we want to simply be the vessel for an infinite arms race?</p>
