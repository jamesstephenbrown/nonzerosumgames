The realisation of the recursive nature of consciousness is a sort of mental loop; "I am inside the universe - but the conscious experience of the universe is inside me - I am inside the universe" creates a loop in the same way in which falling creates a loop "I am falling - prepare to land - I have not landed yet - I am falling". Perhaps then the feeling of anxiety is related to the looping structure of the thought - the sense of bottomlessness - after all, a loop has no bottom. Where the realisation of insignificance can philosophically give someone a physical sensation of falling from a purely academic exercise, for many people a feeling of insignificance can lead people to think that that sensation of falling is inescapable.</p>
