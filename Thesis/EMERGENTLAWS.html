Now, I'm no physicist... but bear with me (sigh), we all have to make sense things and this is my attempt to, I'll try to keep it science-y. In a sense the universe itself may be inevitable. If you look at the way particles can interact, they can either pull or push other particles - this is all they can do. But apply this en masse to a field of points, even completely randomly, and you will create patterns - surprisingly lifelike patterns that will remind you of gravitational bodies, atoms, even life forms. With no design it seems there may be consistent patterns that are inescapable. This is an idea I have explored in <a href ="GRAVITON.html">simulation</a>.</p>
