Susan Blackmore extended the idea of Genes and Memes to propose a "third replicator". Temes are meme factories that operate outside of humans, these include computer programs, particularly emergent systems. Whereas animals and humans were the medium for the first two replicators; Genes and Memes, Temes take over the job of replicator vehicle for Memes. In this sense it is not entirely correct to call them a replicator, if after all they are a replicator vehicle or secondary replicator (Iike humans).  If we concede the primacy of replicators in the process of evolution then Temes could solidify a divergence we see between evolution and humanity putting us at odds with one another.</p>
