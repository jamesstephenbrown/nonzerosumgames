I would propose that realistic hopes for a brighter future should include:<br><br>	Greater fairness and fulfilment of human potential<br>		- because we're in this together<br>	The extension of healthy lives<br>		- because evolution has determined we die, and we don't like it much<br>	Collectively gaining greater control over unhelpful inescapably value-laden experiences<br>		- because we have them, and they're not always in our best interests<br>	A wider empathy and harmony between moral agents<br>		- because the unit of value is conscious experience<br>	A focus on preventative healthcare, including mental health to proactively address criminal justice<br>		- because free will isn't all it's cracked up to be<br>	<br>The question of how to achieve these goals, is one of politics, cultural narratives and the individual, and these will frame argument from here.</p>
