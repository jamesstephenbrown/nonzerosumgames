We have to watch what we eat today because high-calorie food is so abundant in the developed world. We all know this is because the environment now no longer places restrictions on our diet for us. This now extends to other areas too, information for instance, which we have to think more critically about than ever, because it is so abundant. We also have to think about how to best spend our resources and money because, if we are honest with ourselves they are also hugely abundant. However, like with diet, in economics evolution drives us to a scarcity mentality which leads us to cling to tax cuts rather than generosity. This mandate for self-discipline might lead some to envy people in the developing world that might face greater external restrictions; rather than face an array of physical and cognitive diets we could simply live out the adventure we were evolved for.</p>
