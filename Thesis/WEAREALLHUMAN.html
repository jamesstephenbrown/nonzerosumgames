The most effective exit from such downward spirals is to appreciate that "I'm a human and lots of humans have this experience". And this is not just a trick of the mind, a fiction as Sartre would have it. To look at the two claims here, the negative feelings associated with the downward spiral are indeed because you are human, they have evolved to make this state of mind extremely uncomfortable. Knowing this fact might help someone develop some objectivity around this experience. But the second claim that "lots of humans have this experience" is empirical and without evidence that others feel the same way it might be difficult to believe, and here one must rely on others.</p>
