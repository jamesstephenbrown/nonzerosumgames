In "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" Yuval Noah Harari writes about how the 20th century was dominated by grand visions; Communism, Dictatorship, Democracy, Capitalism, The Motherland, The FatherLand, the Ubermensch, the Proletariat, the Enemy of the People, Terrorism, the War on Drugs. This Century we are faced with the reality of a diverse and nuanced global village, with global issues of climate change, overpopulation, inequality, war and displacement that can no longer be solved with such blunt instruments. Grand narratives, by their nature focus on the extremes, and lack the subtlety we need today - in fact, arguably, they didn't serve the 20th Century all that well either.</p>
