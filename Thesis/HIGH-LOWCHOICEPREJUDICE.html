There is a related claim that comes from a study cited in a Big Think article about cognitive ability and prejudice - that high IQ and low IQ individuals are both prejudiced, just towards different groups; people with low IQ are prejudiced against low-choice groups; homosexuals, infidels, classes, women, trans, often racial groups, whereas people with high IQ are prejudiced against high choice groups such as; Christian fundamentalists, big business, the Tea Party, and the military.<br></p>
