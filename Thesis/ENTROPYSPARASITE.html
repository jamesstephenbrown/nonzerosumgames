It appears that emergence requires the existence of an entropic substrate. Entropy, by breaking objects down, and by doing so consistently creates a vast store of raw material from otherwise non-useful material, this has been capitalised on by a process of cosmic and biological natural selection and is now being used by humans to create even greater order in the form of computation by taking yet another product of entropy; sand - and turning it into the silicon-based semi-conductors that power our smart phones and computers.</p>
