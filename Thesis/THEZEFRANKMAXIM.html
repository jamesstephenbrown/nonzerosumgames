Internet philosopher and comedian Ze Frank has a beautiful maxim that encapsulates this situation "The things that make us feel most alone have the greatest power to connect us". Ze Frank playfully experiments with this maxim with his online followers creating art out of people's confessions and insecurities as a sort of communal catharsis. As a sort of scientist of internet virality, he emphasises the value of being open about your own vulnerabilities as the best way to engage with people. It's a non-zero-sum game; it can be cathartic for you and could tell someone out there they are not alone, in turn their response might tell you that you are not alone.</p>
