They say you should never meet your heroes, others warn against having heroes, but the inclination to admire and mimic is innate in us, at least in me, so how do we square this? When I see someone who has the "unmistakeable odour" of greatness or authenticity, I cannot help but try to emulate it. This rarely sustains however, 5 minutes after I've strutted out of the movie theatre as Jason Bourne, I'm buying an ice cream and heading home to sleep and forgetting all about tomorrow's special agent training regime.<br><br>Now, I have, in this essay, criticised self-help, but I'd like to indulge one idea that has stuck for me.</p>
