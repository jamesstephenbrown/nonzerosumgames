Christopher Hitchens described religion as "our first and worst attempt" at the truth, philosophy and morality. Religion has tried to codify values, but due to the pre-scientific / pre-Darwinian worldview in which they were framed, imperatives were rationalised anthropomorphically - an error at the very heart of the venture that produced bizarre results with limited utility. The same error was inferred from the "laws" of nature (which are actually just descriptions of patterns in nature).<br></p>
