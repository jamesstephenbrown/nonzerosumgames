EQUIVOCATION</h1><p>

The formal definition of the fallacy of equivocation is simply “calling two different things by the same name”. Ironically, I am about to technically commit the crime of equivocation by using it to refer also to false analogies and the fallacy of inconsistency; where two arguments or views are claimed to be akin. The reason for this is that it is useful to be able to say “You want to say these two things are the same, but they aren’t” and It’s not helpful to switch between three different terms to refer to essentially the same idea! <br><br>Identity politics is itself a product of equivocation in that a multifaceted political identity is often aligned along one vector - so that those who hold a certain view, or share a characteristic are automatically assumed to hold other views that are not technically related. Equivocations are also made when two sides of an argument are interpreted as mirror images of one another, which leads to an agnostic position, that may not be correct. This is the case in the equivocations between the political activism of the left and right and, as we will see, IQ and prejudice.</p>
