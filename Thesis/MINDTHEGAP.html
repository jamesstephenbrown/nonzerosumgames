If we understand that our <a href ="INESCAPABLYVALUE-LADENEXPERIENCES.html">inescapably value-laden experiences</a> do not necessarily serve the unit of value (conscious experience) then the barriers to conscious well-being can only be tackled by understanding the gap between evolutionary purpose and conscious experience. <a href ="WHYWEDIE.html">We touched on death</a></p>, for instance, if we could deny death we might do so, and this would be departing from our evolutionary purpose. Of course our evolutionary drives still fulfil many useful functions in life, they stop us from unknowingly burning our hand on a stove top element, or forgetting to eat and dying of starvation. But we are all aware that we are mal-adapted to modern day. Another of our conflicting instincts is our overactive fear response which remains poised for mortal danger regardless how peaceful our surroundings.</p>
