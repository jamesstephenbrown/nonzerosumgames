Motivational material is awash with stories of heroes who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps. These stories are impressive and indeed do motivate an individual looking for self-improvement. However, when looked at objectively, the very fact that it is a newsworthy "story" when someone bucks a trend should only serve to confirm the existence of the trend. It is precisely because they are rare, that they make interesting stories. Unfortunately, as I have mentioned, instead what happens is these stories serve to reinforce narratives around individual pursuits and personal responsibility that are so often used by fortunate inheritors of wealth to justify their own good luck - and claim it as a sign of their own story of individual pursuit and personal responsibility.<br>Self-help, is therefore exactly that; motivational for individuals but not suitable for being applied as a norm to society.</p>
