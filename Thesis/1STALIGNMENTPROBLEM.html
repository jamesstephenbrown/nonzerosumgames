We see the emergence of order spontaneously all around us, that is because we are surrounded by systems that perpetuate by capitalising on the meta-process of entropy. For example; as the sun slowly dies via entropy, it leaks an energy stream in such a frequency that it can be consumed by a system that has been naturally selected for that purpose; plants. Gravitational bodies come together for the same reason, as do orbiting systems, as do brains. There are also a 2nd and a 3rd <a href ="ALIGNMENTPROBLEMS.html">alignment problem</a> which we will get to.</p>
