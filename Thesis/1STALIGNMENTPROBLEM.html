        <p>
            We see the emergence of order spontaneously all around us, that is because we are surrounded by systems that perpetuate by capitalising on the meta-process of entropy. For example; as the sun slowly dies via entropy, it leaks an energy stream in such a frequency that it can be consumed by a system that has been naturally selected for that purpose; plants. Gravitational bodies come together for the same reason, as do orbiting systems, as do brains. There are also a <a href="THE2NDALIGNMENTPROBLEMCONSCIOUSNESSVSEVOLUTION.html">2nd</a> and a <a href="THE3RDALIGNMENTPROBLEMGENESVSMEMES.html">3rd</a> alignment problem which we will get to.
