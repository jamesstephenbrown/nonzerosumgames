My use of the word "Should" and "Must" brings to mind David Hume's maxim that you cannot derive an ought from an is, or in other words a value from a fact about nature. And furthermore we've discovered evolution's goals are not necessarily aligned with ours anyway. So, we shouldn't necessarily take on evolutionary imperatives. But, <a href ="EVOLUTIONARYPURPOSE.html">evolutionary purpose</a> is not an imperative handed to us by a deity, it is built into us; disregarding it is not as simple as ignoring it.</p>
