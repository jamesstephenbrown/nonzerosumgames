Evolution has also given us senses that are biased to proximity, genetic and geographic; goods deeds and wrongs done to those close to you will weigh more heavily when we judge our moral position in the world. So, for instance in the Soup Kitchen vs Oxfam example, both actions are virtuous and yet the least effective action (volunteering at the soup kitchen) feels the most rewarding because it's closer to us, and the results are more immediately evident. Therefore the moral licensing we afford ourselves in this situation is much greater. This means that we will be more likely to undo the good we've done in other areas, resulting in a neutral or even negative outcome. This sounds a bit hopeless, but there is a solution.</p>
