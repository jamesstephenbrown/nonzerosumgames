The idea of "Trickle Down Economics" is very popular amongst the very wealthy and is strongly indoctrinated in the entrepreneurial "job creation" class. It is often adopted as the "reason" for being right wing or Libertarian. But this is a lie that has never been realised. While global capitalism has brought low cost goods - those goods are a-moral, there is no rule that says they must benefit society, and we see many examples of "goods" that are very popular that come at a great societal cost: cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, prostitution. In relation to the really important issues of human well-being the free market is simply impotent.</p>
