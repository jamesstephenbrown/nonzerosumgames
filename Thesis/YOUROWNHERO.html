Writer James Clear in "Atomic Habits" has pulled together a wide variety of research to put forward a strong case that a person's qualities are a reflection of their habits. So, if we want to foster traits we admire in others, for instance, an ability to tell good stories or an athletic physique, we are not going to be able to fake that by copying them in the moment, that will also be weird. Copying someone's behavioural traits is like strutting around with your chest puffed out to look like you go to the gym. If we want to be more engaging, we need to find out what engaging people pay attention to, what their habits are. This is the only way to understand what causes the quality that we perceive in their behaviour, and allows us to authentically make it our own. A step further is understanding our own motivations and ambitions and squaring those with our rituals.</p>
