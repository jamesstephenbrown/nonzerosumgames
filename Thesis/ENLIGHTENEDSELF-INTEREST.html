At base enlightened self-interest can justify a range of social contracts and cooperative agreements that are mutually beneficial and mutually low cost. Many supposed altruistic acts can be reduced to this metric and in fact people who are seen to be acting against their own interest are often derided as "Martyrs" and are seen to have some hidden and perhaps perverse motive or are seen to be mentally impaired. </p>
