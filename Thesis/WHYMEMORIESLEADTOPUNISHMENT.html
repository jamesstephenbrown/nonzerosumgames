Humans seem to have an inbuilt instinct to vengeance - to see criminals punished, there is something visceral and satisfying about the experience of seeing someone get their "just desserts". This may be the case, but I would like to add that there is an understandable (albeit bad) reason for seeking to punish. If memories are the only parts of the decision making process we are consciously aware of, then we may feel they are exclusively responsible for our decisions.</p>
