An evaluation function is used by game-playing programs to estimate the value of a particular game position. The idea that "The whole function of the brain is summed up in: error correction" was put forward over 50 years ago by British psychiatrist and cyberneticist W. Ross Ashby. Today, with greater specificity, Neuroscientist Dr. Andy Clark suggests that the brain is perpetually modelling the world and predicting the next state - consciousness therefore is the process asking "What next?" and weighing errors in this predictive state against the raw sensory input. Coded prediction mechanisms like this are used in the compression of .jpegs, mp3s and .mp4 video.</p>
