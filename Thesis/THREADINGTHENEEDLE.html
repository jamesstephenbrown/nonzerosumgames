But is it all just differences in personality? Are there no rational decisions to be made to justify one's views? Can we thread the needle and "capitalise" on the benefits of socialism and capitalism? There have certainly been benefits from the welfare state and the capitalist free market, that can be used to support both cases. Capitalism has created efficient economic systems that serve to distribute some goods and services to people at a fair price. Also various forms of taxation have helped to provide services that capitalism doesn't do so well. However, while we have seen the terrible repercussions of authoritarian communism and have said "never again", we are heading towards the opposite, an out of control capitalism, with unsustainable inequality and lack of social mobility.  Why is this? I would posit that it is because we are yet to see the terrible end point and learn from it. We forget that we have seen the runaway inequality of landed gentry in the centuries before modern history began; with two World Wars.<br></p>
