The Law of Diminishing Returns reflects the reduced value per unit of input, whether it be effort or capital, as the input increases. This is true in almost all systems. For instance, if we want to live longer and be healthy we might conclude that diet is more effective that exercise. As we maximise our dietary health, we will reach a point where we cannot get any healthier through diet, and the only way to get healthier is through exercise. A world where healthy eating was the only metric for measuring health would therefore not result in as great health outcomes as one that balanced diet and exercise.<br></p>
