I have to admit here I am suggesting to the US to adopt a democratic system like the one we have in New Zealand, which has perfect individual representation through a "Party Vote" which allocates the percentage of seats in parliament across the parties and a "local candidate vote" that selects for your local MP. The government is often made up of a coalition of parties that represent a wider range of interests, which mitigates some of the issues around identity politics, because minority views can find a place, regardless of which major party forms the government.</p>
