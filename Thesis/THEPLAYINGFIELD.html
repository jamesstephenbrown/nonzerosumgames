First of all let's look at financial inequality. It is a fact that in 2007 the median net worth of a white American was 15 times that of a black or hispanic American. How could anyone assume that that level of inequality can be successfully remedied by preferential selection to universities and financial aid at the age of 18? Not to say that that's not a valid approach, only that it is woefully inadequate to bridge the gap. To judge success on outcomes compared to the outcomes of a population who have enjoyed a childhood of abundance is naive.<br><br>In the US, 21 percent of Bachelor of Engineering degrees go to women and only 11 percent of practicing engineers are women. While there is a possibility that Peterson is correct about "intrinsic preferences" between genders, there is no way to know what part they play in software engineering until other well-documented contributory factors have been eliminated. For instance, when 20-50% of women report sexual harassment in higher education, it makes it difficult to make definitive claims about the role of gender differences. And this is not as simple as looking at both perspectives here, because it is precisely the perspective that women don't have suitable "intrinsic preferences" with regards to software engineering that is a key "justification" for the bro-culture, toxic cyber-bullying and university and workplace sexual harassment that are known to drive women away from such careers.</p>
