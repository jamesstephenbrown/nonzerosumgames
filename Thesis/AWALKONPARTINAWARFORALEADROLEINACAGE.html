In Pink Floyd's "Wish you were here" when I first heard the lyrics "Did you exchange a walk on part in a war for a lead role in a cage?" I interpreted the lyric as referring to the Vietnam war, questioning a conscientious objector. While this was a misinterpretation, it made me think about the trade off we make in the developed world for security. We are all familiar with the imbalance in reporting in favour of western victims in international conflicts or tragedies at "home". Those in the west are just assumed to value western lives more than those of other people. No doubt there is truth to this and it corresponds with what we've already explored about proximity bias. But there might also be something to the fact that those in the developed world, have been given the choice between security and adventure, and have chosen security.</p>
