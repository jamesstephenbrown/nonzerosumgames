Throughout Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations" he pleads powerlessness to change many things that one might think a king could change. This is largely because Aurelius believes that God has a plan, leading him to make the naturalistic fallacy that "what will be will be", or "everything happens for a reason". This perspective lets the-most-powerful-man-on-earth off the hook with regards to many ills in his society. And it's important to question the idea of powerlessness, because we now live in a world where we are all availed the power of Marcus Aurelius. Every day we have the opportunity to subjugate millions through buying global goods produced inhumanly, and equally we have the opportunity to save lives for "just a dollar a day". Perhaps a stoic philosophy that pleads too much about what is out of our control is not the best approach to take, when we actually have great power.</p>
