Peterson fails to appreciate that Affirmative Action is about levelling the playing field, not fixing the score. It is not solely about outcomes, it is about opportunity. Of course we shouldn't be justifying policies based purely on outcomes, and that is not what is happening. Such policies are never implemented without the acknowledgement of the well-documented disadvantages that particular demographics face. These disadvantages are manifold and difficult to quantify and reversing them is doubly fraught.<br><br>In the words of Frederick Douglass in 1855 "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men".</p>
