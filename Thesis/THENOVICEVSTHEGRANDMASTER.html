If you take a game of chess, a novice player will consciously play out moves as far as they are able, a process of forced simulation, iterating on predictions in their own head before actually making the move. This could give us the illusion that this is how the mind makes decisions. However, take, for instance, the GrandMaster; they play from strong intuitions (neural pathways) about a complex field of possibility, they build a sense of a move, not one specific path. They then model outcomes from a better vantage point than the novice - <a href ="WHATISINTELLIGENCE.html">a mixture of momentary logic with the intuition of a lifetime's experience</a></p><br><br>In our life we are in some places grand-masters and can play well intuitively like walking, talking or driving a car. In those areas, the conscious decision-making that a novice chess player employs in a game is simply read as hesitation, and results mostly in missed opportunities (and of course in a few close calls). We very rarely stop for a full 5 minutes to think about a given path as we would a chess move. More likely we will take a guess or leave the decision until it "comes to us" at a later time. <br><br>The fact that letting something "come to us" is often the best way to make a good decision suggests that conscious decision-making is not only seldom employed, but is also not well trusted. At best it seems that conscious decision-making is simply playing out a trial and error process, based on hunches that originate in our subconscious.</p>
