GALILEO DIDN’T CHANGE THE WORLD</h1><p>

When Galileo demonstrated that the earth was spherical he was not claiming that people should behave differently to when they believed the world was flat, the concepts of “up” and “down” were profoundly changed and yet on the ground none of the rules changed. We did not fall off the earth, the fact that we were spinning at 1,670 kilometres per hour did not put us at risk of crashing into one another. In the same way <a href ="WHATABOUTQUANTUMMECHANICS.html">Quantum mechanics</a> do not (contrary to the thesis of the terrible documentary “What The Bleep Do We Know?”) allow interference with phenomena in the <a href ="MESO-CENTRISM.html">meso-scopic</a> (middle-sized) world in which we live. Even in terms of patterns of human behaviour, the departure from <a href ="OURFIRSTANDWORSTATTEMPT.html">belief in God</a> has not lead to the abandonment of certain moral values (those that are relevant to societal well-being).<br><br>While in terms of the mundane activities of everyday life, these profound changes make little difference, because there is no world where a paradigm could be completely at odds with the everyday experience of all people.<br></p>
