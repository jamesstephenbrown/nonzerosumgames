Another way in which we see better democracy tending left is the discrepancy of the popular vote vs the electoral college in the US. Take for instance that, the last time the democratic party were taken out of office on the back of a republican popular vote win was in 1980 when Reagan won the popular vote with 50.7%. While in office republican candidates have won the popular vote (acknowledging that presidents generally do better in their 2nd term than their first) G.W.Bush and Trump both lost the popular vote to take office for their first terms. Could it be that, had the US been a truly democratic country we might have seen 25 years of democrats? At least we might have seen a less polarising Republican party.</p>
