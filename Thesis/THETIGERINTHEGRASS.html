The animal who scares easily from a rustle in the bushes, will live its life on edge, and will run away from a great many phantoms. But on the one occasion when the rustle in the bushes is a tiger, it may just survive, whereas its more relaxed companions may not, and so our inherited genes dictate that we live on edge, even today, where the threat of tigers is no more.<br><br>Now, where mortal danger is almost eradicated, this default to fear leads to many deleterious behaviours; fear of public speaking, fear of others, fear of the dark, fear of trying new things.</p>
