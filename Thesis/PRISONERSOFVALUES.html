On the other hand people may be stuck with core values that shape every other value in self-destructive or anti-social ways. For instance someone who has been abused may override all other human emotions with the drive to maintain power, safety or seek vengeance. In fact some <a href ="MINDFULLNESS.html">mindfulness</a> meditation programs in prisons have been found to backfire for this very reason. Researchers lead by clinical psychology professor June P Tangney noted that…<br><br>“This level of non-judgment and acceptance may not be as beneficial for people suffering from externalising disorders marked by higher levels of impulsivity.
