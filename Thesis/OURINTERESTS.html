There might be a way through conditioning or conversation to intercept these pathways and bring healthier values into play. The idea of this <a href ="MODULARESSAY.html">modular essay</a></p>, is a position that while it is naive to build an ethical framework based on altruism, it is reasonable to believe that I could convince others to better act in their own best interests. So, if it is the case that everyone at present is not acting in their own best interests and are also doing so in a way that is detrimental to human well-being as a whole (a negative sum "lose-lose" game), then helping people to act with enlightened self-interest would make the world a better place.</p>
