What is at stake here is the fact that change in unavoidable, but can happen in two ways. It can either come as a piecemeal process, or as wholesale revolution. There are many examples of revolutions that have lead to progress; the French revolution (eventually), the American (eventually), and many that have lead to regression; the communist and fascistic revolutions of the early 20th century. Revolutions are sometimes fruitful, but always destructive. Piecemeal processes however are often the unsung heroes of progress; the civil rights movement, in its adoption of peaceful protest, was more evolutionary than revolutionary - the change is slow, but consistent. This is important in all systems, including the individual, which is a system in itself, and to change individual minds, we need to appreciate how that system works.<br></p>
