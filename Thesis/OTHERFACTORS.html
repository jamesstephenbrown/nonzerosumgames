The contributory factors with regards to populations facing historical baggage, poverty, high rates of crime, single parent households and a host of other societal ills are simply not quantifiable. Any researcher who claims they have definitively ruled out all other causal factors is not being intellectually honest. Chiefly, when correcting for other contributory factors in such research you are only able to correct with respect to known findings.</p>
