Equivocation often takes the form of a "Gotcha" argument where you accuse your opponent of doing exactly what they're criticising. But in the case of the Intellectual Dark Web, it seems undeniably ironic that a group so against identity politics has found themselves united as victims of anti-free speech. This identity then also falls victim to attempts by members such as Dave Rubin to draw lines of allegiance to the Libertarian camp - exactly as the definition goes of identity politics goes; we all believe this, therefore we should all believe this other thing.<br><br>At the same time, there are logical connections between different political categories that can explain much of what appears like simple identity politics.</p>
